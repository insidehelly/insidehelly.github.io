    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>The cheap beer tastes awful, but Helena keeps sipping it anyway. It couldn't have been easy to get and she doesn't want to seem ungrateful. The pool party assaults her senses, sensory overload designed to torture introverts. Loud music blasts into the open air while voices shriek over the noise. Her personal hell, basically. But at least Helly is here, lounging on a deck chair beside her like a human security blanket, her presence the only thing keeping Helena tethered to sanity.</p><p>The pressure in Helena's bladder has been building since her second beer. She shifts uncomfortably in her chair, crossing and uncrossing her legs from every possible angle. The sensation is becoming impossible to ignore—a sharp, insistent ache that makes her want to double over.</p><p>"Helly," she says, leaning closer to her sister. "Have you been in Jenna's house before? Where's the bathroom?"</p><p>Helly glances towards the house, shrugging. "I don't think we're allowed to go inside."</p><p>Helena's stomach drops. "Where am I supposed to go then?"</p><p>"Just hold it," Helly says casually, taking another swig of her beer.</p><p>Hold it. As if she could simply will herself to control the uncontrollable. Helly knows this better than anyone—knows exactly how her body has betrayed her in the past—but she's four beers in and completely checked out. Ever since Father started bearing down harder, Helly has been disappearing piece by piece. The sister who once moved mountains to solve Helena's problems now dwells in some unreachable place behind her own eyes.</p><p>Her bladder feels like it might burst. The thought of losing control here, in front of all these people, makes her want to disappear into the ground. They've already been here for two hours, more than enough performance time to claim they "went to the party" like normal teenagers. Home may be another cage, but it's <em> her </em> cage, complete with the holy trinity of comfort: her bed, her books, and most importantly, her <em> bathroom</em>.</p><p>"Ready to head out? I've just about had enough," Helena says, each word carefully measured to hide the desperation clawing at her insides. She'd rather die than admit that time hasn't fixed her. That her body may have grown but her bladder hasn't. That she's still the same defective thing that used to soil her sheets like an animal.</p><p>Helly shoots her a look. "Fuck no."</p><p>"But you were making such good progress on your painting. Don't you want to finish it?"</p><p>Helly crushes her empty can between her hands with brutal force, and Helena knows exactly whose throat her sister is picturing. "With Father home? Please," she scoffs.</p><p>Helena looks around desperately. Her peers are scattered across the deck and lawn, but the pool is relatively empty—just a few people floating lazily in inflatable rafts. The water suddenly looks like salvation.</p><p>"Hey," Helena says, trying to keep her voice light. "Want to get in the pool? It looks like fun."</p><p>Helly glances at the water with zero enthusiasm. "Nah, I don't really want to get in right now."</p><p>Helena's panic spirals out of control. She needs to get in that fucking pool. Needs the cover, the privacy, needs to empty her screaming bladder before it empties itself on this chair. Before she's branded forever as the girl who pissed herself at Jenna's pool party. But she can't go alone—it's too obvious. She needs Helly as camouflage.</p><p>"Come on," Helena tries again, attempting a smile. "It'll be fun. We haven't been swimming together in forever."</p><p>"I'm good here," Helly says, settling back in her chair.</p><p>Helena shifts again, clamping her thighs together so hard her muscles ache. The pressure shifts from a desperate plea to downright painful. She can feel her body starting to give, the first treacherous drops threatening to escape, and pure terror takes over.</p><p>"Please?" The word cracks on the way out. "Just for a little bit?"</p><p>Helly's eyes narrow slightly. Helena worries she's giving herself away—sitting with her legs crossed three times over, shoulders locked with stress, panic bleeding through every word. She can't hide it anymore. She just needs to get in the water.</p><p>"Please, Helly. I really want to swim with you," she says through gritted teeth.</p><p>"God, you're so fucking annoying," Helly mutters, standing up reluctantly. "Fine. Let's get in."</p><p>Relief floods through Helena so intensely she almost starts crying. "Really?"</p><p>"Yeah, come on."</p><p>Helena uncrosses her legs to stand up, and that does it. She'd needed every muscle holding tight to keep the dam from bursting. She can feel the warmth leaking out of her, a small dribble collecting in her swimsuit, threatening to soak through any second. Her eyes widen before she catches herself, trying to look normal. Trying to do anything but draw attention to herself.</p><p>She starts speed walking to the pool. She can feel it soaking through now. The dribble turns aggressive, turning into a proper stream. Fuck. <em> Fuck</em>. This can't actually be happening. She glances around, trying to look casual. No one's watching. She just needs to reach that fucking pool.</p><p>She's a few feet from the edge when it starts running down her leg. Warm, wet, <em> visible</em>. Anyone looking in her direction could see her failure to control herself, how utterly disgusting she is, pissing herself like a child. She can't bring herself to look around. Helly's trailing behind her. <em> Please be too drunk to notice. </em></p><p>She gets to the pool edge and throws herself into the water. The moment she's submerged, she lets go completely. The relief is so immediate and overwhelming she nearly cries. Her bladder empties in a long, powerful release, the warmth spreading around her in the cool water. </p><p>Helly jumps in next to her, and Helena's relief turns to horror. The heat spreads around her legs and torso and she knows—absolutely knows—that Helly can feel it too. Her sister is standing right next to her, close enough that the warmth is impossible to miss. She tries desperately to cut off the stream, to clamp down now that some pressure's gone, but her body won't listen. She waited too long. Her muscles have given up completely.</p><p>Helena watches Helly's face carefully, bracing for the revulsion to hit. But Helly just stares straight ahead with a neutral expression. Her mouth twitches slightly, like she's trying very hard not to react to something.</p><p>"Yeah," Helly says dryly. "This sure is fun."</p><p>Helena's still going—her bladder seems endless, emptying what feels like days worth of pent-up pressure. She tries to edge away from Helly, but Helly moves with her. Almost defensively, like she's forming a barrier between Helena and the world.</p><p>An unexpected laugh escapes Helly's throat, quiet but unmistakable, and Helena's heart drops. Helly leans in close, breath tickling Helena's ear.</p><p>"Are you still going?"</p><p>Helena's face flames red. She stares straight ahead, refusing to acknowledge the question. "I don't know what you're talking about."</p><p>"I'll take that as a yes," Helly laughs.</p><p>Helena wants to disappear. Wants to sink to the pool floor and dissolve into the concrete. But then Helly moves even closer, pressing their shoulders together.</p><p>"It's fine. Really," Helly says, voice barely audible over the relentless bass that just keeps getting more obnoxious. "Here. I'll go too."</p><p>Helena's eyes snap to her sister's face, a look of intense focus for just a moment before melting into relief. Helena feels fresh warmth spreading from Helly's direction. Her sister is actually doing it, actually pissing herself in solidarity. The gesture is so unexpectedly kind that Helena feels tears prick at her eyes.</p><p>"Ew, Helly," she says, trying to sound disgusted even though she's never felt more grateful for anything in her life. "That's gross."</p><p>"Thanks for the idea," Helly says with a grin. "I had to go pretty bad."</p><p>"I wasn't—I didn't—I just wanted to swim," Helena insists, pathetically. Helly knows. Helena knows Helly knows, and they both know this denial is bullshit. She can't bring herself to admit it anyway. </p><p>"Yeah, okay," Helly retorts, mockery thick in her voice. "That's why it was dripping down your leg, right?"</p><p>Helena has nothing to say. She considers drowning herself for a moment. She heard it isn't even the worst way to go. Now seems like a good time. Better to be remembered as the girl who drowned at the party than the girl who pissed herself.</p><p>Still, as the water grows warmer around them, the crushing mortification begins to lift a little. Helly will undoubtedly torment her about this forever, but she can feel her sister's protective warmth wrapping around her—literally. Trust Helly to wade into Helena's shame without a second thought. At least she's not facing this nightmare alone.</p><p>They stay in the water longer than necessary, letting the evidence disperse before climbing out. When they finally do emerge, Helly doesn't mention it again. She just hands Helena her towel and launches into some random story—like nothing unusual happened at all.</p><p> </p><p align="center">༺☆༻</p><p> </p><p>Sitting cross-legged on her bed, Helena scrolls through her feed. A mindless, familiar pattern she can sink into after the chaos of the party. Just her and Helly, engulfed in the safety of their room, phones lighting up with the occasional tweet they pass back and forth. A soft rhythm, a language all their own.</p><p>The embarrassment from earlier still lingers, but it's dulled now. Faint enough to ignore. Helly hasn't said a word about what happened. Maybe the alcohol wiped it clean from her memory. Maybe Helena can let it dissolve into one of those cringe-worthy memories that only ambush her in quiet moments, when her mind wanders to places it shouldn't go.</p><p>Then Helly starts laughing, staring at the ceiling with a stupid grin on her face.</p><p>"What's so funny?" Helena asks, barely looking up from her screen.</p><p>"Nothing," Helly says, still grinning.</p><p>"No, really. What?" She looks over to find Helly biting her lip, shoulders shaking with suppressed laughter.</p><p>Helly rolls onto her side, propping her head up on her hand. "I can't believe you pissed yourself."</p><p>Helena's blood turns to ice. "I didn't."</p><p>"Helena, you left a trail on your way to the pool," Helly says, eyebrows raised. "Just admit it."</p><p>Helena stares at her phone screen, the words blurring together. She can't bring herself to speak, can't form any response that doesn't sound pathetic.</p><p>Helly rolls her eyes and gets up, crossing the space between their beds in a few large, exaggerated steps before flopping onto Helena's. "Oh, come on."</p><p>Before Helena can protest, Helly wraps her arms around her and pulls her close, wrestling her down onto her pillow.</p><p>"You're so fucking funny," Helly mumbles against her hair, and there's so much warmth in her voice that Helena can't even be mad. The weight of Helly's arms still makes her feel invincible, like nothing can reach her here. They used to be this close all the time—casual intimacy that happened without thought. She can't remember when they stopped, when Helly started pulling away. </p><p>Helly presses a quick kiss to Helena's cheek, then nuzzles in, her nose brushing softly against her temple before settling behind her. Helena catalogs every point of contact—chest pressed to back, arm draped over waist, breath warm against the sensitive skin of her neck. She tries to memorize it all, to lock this moment away for when she needs it most.</p><p>"Here, keep scrolling," Helly says, picking up Helena's phone and pressing it back into her hand. "Let's see what kind of weird shit is in your algorithm."</p><p>Reluctantly, Helena starts scrolling, hyperaware of Helly watching over her shoulder. Then she feels it—Helly's thigh slipping between her legs, pressing firmly against her core through their pajamas. The contact makes her breath catch, a reaction she tries to smother.</p><p>Surely—<em>surely</em>—Helly doesn't realize where her leg is. It has to be accidental. She forces herself to keep scrolling, to act normal, as she feels her heartbeat ricochet back off Helly's thigh. She fights the overwhelming urge to rock her hips, to seek the friction her body is screaming for.</p><p>"You know," Helly says casually, her voice right next to Helena's ear, "we should probably get you one of those little kid bathroom timers. Set it to go off every hour so you don't forget."</p><p>"Shut up," Helena mutters, but there's no real heat behind it.</p><p>"I'm serious. They make them with little songs and everything. 'Time to go potty!'" Helly sings in a high-pitched voice.</p><p>Helena elbows her in the stomach. "I hate you."</p><p>She should've known Helly wouldn't drop it. She's just grateful it's happening in private instead of at school. Once upon a time, that wouldn't have even been a concern—Helly would never have betrayed her like that. But lately there's something different about her sister, something sharp and unpredictable. Helena can't shake the feeling that the teasing might have real teeth now.</p><p>But rational thought starts to blur at the edges, overwhelmed by the heat of Helly's body pressed against her. Her worries feel like they're happening to someone else, her mind going hazy with sensation. She can't help but press back into Helly's embrace, the thigh between her legs grinding against her with the movement. Helena has to bite her lip to keep from making a sound.</p><p>"I'm just looking out for you," Helly continues, seemingly oblivious. "Can't have my baby sister pissing herself at every social event."</p><p>The way Helly calls her <em> baby sister </em> makes something flutter in her chest that she doesn't want to examine too closely. She's never called her that before. Everything feels dizzyingly off-kilter, like she's stepped sideways into a world where everything looks the same but nothing quite is.</p><p>She keeps scrolling through her feed, trying to focus on anything other than the way Helly's thigh keeps brushing against her core with every small movement. It's just a physical reaction, she tells herself. Bodies respond to pressure—it's basic biology, nothing more. It doesn't mean anything. She's not telling Helly to move, but that's just because... because it would be weird to bring attention to it. Better to just ignore it.</p><p>And it's not like her sister would do this on purpose. It's just typical Helly, clueless and inconsiderate, annoyingly unaware. She's just cuddling, the way they always have. The fact that Helena's body is responding inappropriately isn't Helly's fault. It's her own. She needs to get a hold of herself. She just needs to get a hold of herself.</p><p>Helena's trying to convince herself of this when a video starts auto-playing on her feed—some guy fucking a woman from behind, her moans filling the quiet room through Helena's phone speakers.</p><p>"WHOA!" Helly shouts directly in Helena's ear, making her flinch so hard she nearly drops her phone.</p><p>"God, you scared me," Helena gasps, frantically trying to scroll past the video.</p><p>"I didn't know you watch porn," Helly says, and Helena can hear the grin in her voice.</p><p>"I don't," Helena insists, her face burning. "It just—it just popped up on my feed. I don't know why."</p><p>"Uh huh," Helly says, sounding completely unconvinced.</p><p>Helly's thigh moves more deliberately now, grinding against her with unmistakable intention. The realization makes her blood turn cold—this isn't accidental. It never was. Helly has been doing this on purpose while Helena just…took it. Enjoyed it, even. The shame burns through her. What kind of disgusting person lets their sister do this?</p><p>"Scroll back up," Helly says, her voice lower now, her hot breath ghosting across Helena's cheek. "I want to watch the whole thing."</p><p>Helena's hand freezes on her phone. She can feel her heart hammering against her ribs. This is insane. But she can't bring herself to pull away, can't even bring herself to tell Helly to stop.</p><p>"I don't think we should—" Helena starts weakly.</p><p>"Come on," Helly begs, and Helena can feel her lips almost brushing her ear. "It's a short one."</p><p>Helena's thumb hovers over the screen, trembling slightly. She feels like she's losing her mind, caught between the wrongness of what's happening and the desperate ache building inside her.</p><p>She scrolls back up.</p><p>The video plays again, and Helena feels completely trapped in her own desire. Her mouth floods with saliva, throat working frantically to swallow as her body prepares for something she won't let herself name. </p><p>The seam of Helena's pajama pants digs directly into her clit, creating unbearable friction where Helly's thigh grinds against her. Her eyes flutter shut and she digs her nails deep into her palm, trying to focus on the dull pain.</p><p>Then Helly speaks, her voice so close to Helena's ear that her lips brush the shell of it.</p><p>"Have you ever jerked off?"</p><p>
  <em> God, what the fuck is happening. </em>
</p><p>"No," Helena manages. "That's gross."</p><p>Helly laughs, the sound vibrating through Helena's body where they're pressed together. "Oh my god, everyone does it. You're literally the only person on earth who thinks touching yourself is some kind of sin."</p><p>"It is," Helena insists weakly, though she's not sure she believes it anymore. It's just easier than facing her own depravity.</p><p>"Don't you feel turned on right now?" Helly asks, her thigh pressing harder, more deliberately. "This video is really hot. I can feel how tense you are."</p><p>Helena's breath catches. Can Helly feel how wet she's getting? The thought makes her burn with humiliation and something darker. "No," she lies, even as heat pools between her legs.</p><p>"Bullshit," Helly mumbles against her ear. "Your breathing changed. You're practically panting."</p><p>"No I'm fucking not," she protests a little too hard.</p><p>"Well, I really need to get off," Helly says, her voice dropping. "Do you mind if I do that here?"</p><p>Helena wants it worse than anything on earth—wants to watch, wants to feel Helly lose control against her—but she'd rather die than admit it. She should stop this. She needs to stop this.</p><p>"Whatever, weirdo," she mutters instead. She can't believe how weak she is.</p><p>Helly laughs and, without shifting away, pulls back the arm draped over Helena's waist, down into her own waistband. Helena can feel it happening against her back: the shift of muscle, the friction of motion as she starts to touch herself. </p><p>"God, this feels so good," Helly sighs. "You have no idea what you're missing. I bet you'd love this—probably help you stop having such a stick up your ass all the time."</p><p>"That's disgusting," Helena manages, but the words sound hollow to her own ears. She's so turned on she can't even think, her body demanding the same relief Helly's giving herself.</p><p>"Is it though?" Helly's voice is getting breathy now, strained with effort. "Because you haven't moved away. And you keep making these little sounds—"</p><p>"I'm not making any sounds," Helena protests, but even as she says it, she realizes she can hear herself. Tiny, helpless whimpers escape despite her best efforts.</p><p>"Fuck," Helly moans softly as the guy in the video climaxes, her body shivering against Helena's back.</p><p>The video ends, and Helly's voice is rough when she speaks. "Restart it. I'm not done yet."</p><p>Helena's hand shakes as she taps the screen, her vision blurry. "Are you gonna be done soon?"</p><p>"I'll be done when I'm done," Helly says. "Sure you don't wanna try?"</p><p>Helena squeezes her eyes shut, fighting every instinct in her body. "I'm sure."</p><p>"Your loss," Helly whispers, and Helena can feel her smile against her.</p><p>Helena's body is strung tight, skin alive with knowledge of what's happening behind her. Each shift of her sister's arms sends ripples through her spine, syncing Helena's breath to the rhythm of Helly's strokes. She can hear the wet sounds now, slick and obscene, feel them in the trembling press of Helly's body. And her breath—hot, humid—pours against Helena's ear in desperate, stuttering pants. She wants to turn around, wants to watch Helly's face, wants to press her mouth to those gasping lips. Instead she lies frozen, every muscle tense with want.</p><p>"I'm probably gonna come soon," Helly whispers, her voice thick and strained.</p><p>"Good for you," Helena manages, but the words crack on the way out, barely more than a breath. She could cry with how badly she wants to feel Helly's release tear through her, wants to be pinned against her sister as she loses control. Her own body betrays her, her arousal soaking completely through her pajamas, the fabric clinging wetly where Helly's thigh meets her core.</p><p>"Yeah," Helly's voice breaks, higher now, desperate. "I'm about to come."</p><p>Then Helly's voice dissolves into desperate whispers right against Helena's neck: "Oh god, I'm coming—" and Helena feels like she might explode from the intimacy of it. Helly's whole body goes rigid against her back, then starts shaking, trembling through wave after wave of release, little aftershocks making her gasp and moan. Finally, she lets out a long, shaky sigh and goes limp, immediately draping her arm back over Helena. Her fingers are still slick.</p><p>"Ew, Helly," Helena says automatically, but the charade falls on two pairs of deaf ears. </p><p>"Whatever. You don't really care."</p><p>Helena opens her mouth to protest, but nothing comes out. It's true—she can't even pretend. If anything, she wants those fingers closer, preferably in her mouth. She blinks away the impulse. Just an intrusive thought testing her own boundaries. She can't actually, possibly feel like that, right? Christ.</p><p>Helly laughs again, delighted. "Oh my god, you're still watching the video. Look at you—you pretend to be above it but you're a little perv, aren't you?"</p><p>Helena's face flushes, lust and shame tangled under her skin. </p><p>"I can literally feel you dripping onto my leg," Helly continues. "Just touch yourself already. You're desperate for it."</p><p>She can't hide it anymore, can't pretend. The need is eating her alive from the inside out.</p><p>"Okay. I'll try it," she says in a whisper so quiet she's not even sure if Helly heard.</p><p>"I fucking knew it!" Helly practically crows with victory. "You're so fake. Acting all disgusted when you're dying to get off."</p><p>Helena can't bring herself to care about how insufferably annoying her sister is being. Pride is a luxury she can't afford when her body is screaming for relief. </p><p>"I don't know how to do it," she confesses.</p><p>"Want me to show you?" Helly asks, and Helena can hear the sick satisfaction in her voice. Thrilled to be the only one who can fix her sister's problems, saving Helena from a humiliation she herself engineered. </p><p>"Yeah, I guess," she breathes, expecting Helly to demonstrate on herself.</p><p>Her eyes fly open when Helly's hand slides down the front of her pajama pants instead. Before she can even react, Helly yanks her in tighter, pressing their bodies together so hard Helena feels her sister's breasts flatten against her back. She's being positioned, manhandled like some pliable doll Helly needs at the right angle to get the job done. And then Helly finds her clit, slick with arousal, and Helena's mouth falls open in a sound she's never made before.</p><p>"Holy shit," Helly laughs softly. "Wow, you really are turned on. You're soaked."</p><p>Her fingers move in brisk, thoughtless circles, the way someone might treat their own body after years of knowing exactly what gets them off. No warm-up, no mercy. Helena's not ready. She's raw, oversensitive, but Helly doesn't slow down—doesn't even seem to realize she should.</p><p>"Alright, so, this is your clit—see how good that feels?" She talks in a casual tone, like she's giving a biology lesson. "God, you're swollen. You must have been dying."</p><p>She <em> has </em>been. She's never felt this much blood flooding down there before, never been this hyper-aware of every nerve ending. That little nub she's spent her life pretending doesn't exist feels huge now—hot and rigid and impossible to ignore. Every pass of Helly's fingers makes her hips twitch, her breath stutter. She's already spiraling toward the edge, faster than she thought possible. It's terrifying how quickly she's unraveling, how badly she wants to come.</p><p>Helly teases at her entrance, gathering slickness before sliding two fingers inside. "Sorry, the angle's weird. I can't get that deep."</p><p>Helena bites down hard on the inside of her cheek, desperate to stay grounded.</p><p>"But if I could, I'd probably hit your G-spot. It's deeper in," Helly goes on, still in that maddeningly calm tone. "Try it on your own sometime, okay?"</p><p>"Okay," Helena whispers, eyes burning. Despite the bad angle, she feels stretched, filled—like Helly's fingers were made to fit inside her, like her body had been waiting for this.</p><p>"Which feels better?" Helly asks as she shallowly thrusts her fingers.</p><p>"The first thing," Helena chokes out, her voice breaking on the words.</p><p>"Yeah, I figured," Helly muses. "Okay, well don't get used to this. I'm only gonna do this for you once, so pay attention."</p><p>Helly focuses on her clit, finding the rhythm like she's tuning an instrument. Helena knows, with aching certainty, that this is it. The summit of something irreversible, the high point of everything she's ever felt. </p><p>She wants to stretch the moment, to drink it in, but the pleasure builds maddeningly fast. She's ignored her body for too long, and now it's come to collect what it's owed. It's out of her hands, dragging her under before she can understand the pull of the wave.</p><p>"Oh god, it's happening," she gasps. "I think I'm about to come."</p><p>"Good girl," Helly breathes against her ear. "Let it happen. Just let go."</p><p>It hits like a rupture—it breaks her open from the inside out. Her body jerks, shudders, arches toward Helly's hand. And then the flood: wet heat spilling from her in a rush, drenching everything. For one suspended moment, panic claws up her throat. <em> She's pissing herself. Again. </em> But then the pleasure crests higher, eclipsing her shame, and for one brief, blinding moment, she doesn't care.</p><p>"Fuck, fuck, <em> fuck</em>," she keeps repeating, unable to stop the flow, unable to stop anything. Her body makes the decision for her.</p><p>When her orgasm finally subsides, everything is soaked—her pajamas, the sheets, Helly's hand. Helena slumps over, panting, horrified and blissful in equal measure.</p><p>"Whoa," Helly says, sounding genuinely impressed. "You squirted."</p><p>"What—what the fuck does that mean?" Helena pants, still trying to catch her breath.</p><p>"It just means you came really hard."</p><p>"I didn't piss myself?"</p><p>Helly laughs. "No, you didn't piss yourself for the second time today. Jesus."</p><p>Helena feels so relieved she could cry.</p><p>She doesn't turn around, but she can see it in her peripheral vision. Helly lifts her hand—clearly thinking Helena can't see her from that angle—and inhales, chest rising against Helena's back. She moves them closer to her nose—no, her mouth, like she's weighing the thought of tasting her fingers. But something stops her. Too filthy, even for her. Or maybe she's just worried she'll get caught. She wipes her fingers on the sodden sheets instead. </p><p>Helly peels herself away and walks over to her dresser for a change of clothes. Helena hadn't even realized she squirted all over her legs.</p><p>"Don't tell anyone about this," Helly commands.</p><p>As if Helena needed to be told. She makes eye contact for the first time since everything started. It sends waves through her stomach that feel like more than just physical arousal, seeping out from some broken place inside her that Helly's touch cracked open. She pushes it down, desperately, horrified at what she's becoming.</p><p>"And seriously, I mean it—that was a one time thing. I know I'm good at it, but I can't keep doing <em> everything </em>for you all the time," Helly insists.</p><p>Helena coughs out a weak, performative scoff. "Whatever, fuck you."</p><p>"Yeah, and you're welcome, by the way."</p><p> </p><p align="center">༺☆༻</p><p> </p><p>Helena drops her backpack by the door with force, and a satisfying thud echoes throughout the empty hallway. The house feels delightfully cavernous after the suffocating press of bodies in the school corridors. </p><p>She's been running on fumes for days now, keeping her schedule packed tight with student council meetings, study groups, swim team, <em> anything </em>to keep her mind off of what happened the other day.</p><p>Anything to keep her away from Helly.</p><p>But today, her excuses run out. Helly trails in behind her, tossing her bag somewhere in the general direction of Helena's.</p><p>"Jesus, finally, I thought Mrs. Hampton was never gonna shut up about the fucking Renaissance," Helly grumbles.</p><p>"The test is next week," Helena says automatically, already headed toward the empty kitchen. A few hours of reprieve before their father gets home from work. "You should probably—"</p><p>"Hey." Helly catches her wrist, and Helena's skin feels like it might flame off at the contact. "I feel like I haven't seen you in forever. Like, <em> actually </em>seen you. We've been ships passing in the night or whatever."</p><p>Helena's throat tightens around what she actually wants to say. She pulls her wrist free gently. "I've just been busy. You know how Father wants me to be more involved—"</p><p>"Right, I know," Helly interrupts again. "I just miss hanging out with you."</p><p><em> Miss hanging out. </em> As if what happened between them the last time they <em> hung out </em> was normal sister bonding. As if Helena hasn't been replaying it every free moment since, breathing deeply just to keep from screaming into the toilet.</p><p>"You've been distant for weeks," Helena challenges. "This isn't anything new."</p><p>"Huh? No I haven't," Helly responds, and her eyes glaze over as if she's reaching for a memory that isn't there. Had she even been aware of it? For a moment, Helena envisions herself without the constant weight of self-examination, wonders how much sharper her own edges might be if shame didn't file them down.</p><p>"Okay, well, you have been," Helena says flatly, grabbing a water from the fridge. "So don't try to guilt trip me."</p><p>"I'm not," Helly responds, furrowing her brow, an edge of frustration in her voice she doesn't bother to hide. "Fucks sake, I just miss you. And you're trying to pick a fight."</p><p>"I'm not," Helena insists, though she realizes in that moment that she probably is.</p><p>"Whatever. I'm not fighting with you," Helly grumbles, clearly trying to calm herself down. She shoulder checks Helena at the fridge and grabs a soda. "Let's go watch something."</p><p>Before she even has a chance to think about it, to come up with an excuse, Helly's already trailing off toward their room. Helena follows, of course.</p><p> </p><p align="center">༺☆༻</p><p> </p><p>She'd been so sure Helly would be disgusted with her. Had spent the past few days avoiding their shared spaces whenever possible, taking the long route to classes, even timing her bathroom breaks to miss Helly between periods. All because she was convinced Helly would regret it, that when she looked at her now she'd see exactly what Helena is: someone sick enough to get off on her own sister's touch. Depraved enough to want it again. </p><p>But staring at her now, she just looks… normal. Maybe a little tired from the long day, maybe slightly annoyed at Helena's bristliness, but no revulsion, no disgust that Helena had spent long nights awake preparing for.</p><p>Helena moves from the doorway and starts mindlessly trudging to her own bed.</p><p>"Hey," Helly snaps. "Jesus, you really are avoiding me. Just sit on my bed. Better view of the TV."</p><p>"Oh," Helena shakes out of her daze. "Yeah, duh."</p><p>She scoots onto Helly's bed, careful to leave a few inches of space between them. It strikes her then that she's afraid of Helly. Really, truly afraid of her. Her heart rate spikes, her stomach goes sour, and she feels like she can't take a deep breath. It makes her want to cry. Her sister used to be the antidote to this feeling, not the cause.</p><p>"You're being such an asshole," Helly says, tensing. "You literally <em> asked </em>me to show you how to touch yourself, and now you're treating me like—what, like I'm some kind of creep?"</p><p>Helena blinks. "What?"</p><p>"I can see you literally inching away from me right now. I never—I was doing you a favor."</p><p>"I know you were," Helena says, shaking her head. She feels awful, making Helly feel like this. She never meant to bleed her shame onto her sister, to stain her with something so ugly. "Helly, I'm sorry. I felt bad, that's all."</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"I don't know," Helena says, and it's not entirely false. Just mostly. </p><p>"Is it because I helped you and you didn't help me?"</p><p>Not even a little bit. But she's clearly trying to get her bearings on the situation. Fishing for logic where none exists, trying to map Helena's guilt onto something she can understand. Helena would rather eat a loaded shotgun than try to explain the rot that lives inside her, with her stomach in her throat and her heart pounding against her ribs.</p><p>"Yeah, maybe—yeah, that's probably it."</p><p>"Oh," Helly's voice lights up, relieved of the burden and excited for the possibilities of the implication—the implication Helena hadn't considered until the words already left her mouth. "Why didn't you just say so? I don't mind."</p><p>Helena swallows. Maybe she means something else. "Don't mind what?"</p><p>"You returning the favor," Helly says, tilting her head. "I actually haven't—this is so funny, I haven't gotten off since the other day, with you. Haven't had time, I guess, so this is really great timing."</p><p>Helena's vision goes blurry. "Um—"</p><p>"But I doubt you'll be able to get me off with your hand. I mean, no offense, but have you even touched yourself since I showed you how?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Yeah, there's no way I'll be able to come from that, so you should probably use your mouth."</p><p>Surely she misheard her. She stares at Helly, searching her face for any sign that this is some kind of a joke—some test she's failing.</p><p>"Say that again?"</p><p>"Easier to come from bad oral than bad hand work. At least that's what I've heard," Helly says, shrugging. "And I can tell you're gonna be pretty terrible at both."</p><p>"Fuck you," Helena says and she's not sure how it comes out. Not even sure how she meant for it to come out. Everything between them feels scrambled. She doesn't know who Helly is anymore—familiar and foreign, terrifying and irresistible. A paradoxical, gravitational pull, threatening to collapse them both.</p><p>"Again, no offense, just being honest," Helly says, flashing that insufferably smug smile Helena knows by heart. The one that's always made Helena's blood boil. This time the heat pools somewhere else entirely.</p><p>"I don't know. We shouldn't be doing any of this," she protests, a performance to say she tried. "And what you're asking… it's really too far."</p><p>"You owe me," Helly says flatly. She's come to collect her debt and won't leave until it's repaid. The logic is sound; it's out of Helena's hands. She has to do this. It's only fair.</p><p>"Okay," Helena says quietly.</p><p>"Yeah? Cool. Thanks."</p><p>Relief flickers across Helly's face, followed by unmistakable hunger, and a flash of something else—like she can't really believe it. Didn't expect to get this far, maybe. She quickly smooths her expression back to that familiar smirk. Helena watches the mask resettle and says nothing about it. Maybe she never saw it at all.</p><p>They sit there for a moment, the weight of what they've just agreed to settling between them. Helena's hands shake in her lap as she tries to focus on the TV. Some commercial is playing. She's not even sure what show is on.</p><p>"Should we…" Helly starts, then stops, looking everywhere but Helena's eyes.</p><p>"Now?" Helena asks, biting her lip.</p><p>"Yeah."</p><p>"Sure."</p><p>"Okay. So…" Helly says, turning to face her, and Helena can see her trying to figure out the logistics. "How do we... I mean, how do you want to do this?"</p><p>Helena's face flushes hot. "I don't know. You're the one who wanted to do this—<em>you </em> figure it out."</p><p>"Yeah, I <em> know </em>that, I was just… trying to make sure you were comfortable," Helly sighs, rolling out of bed. "It's fine, I'm used to doing everything."</p><p>She unbuttons her jeans and slides them down, then her underwear, stepping out of both in one fluid motion. Helena's gaze falls to the patch of red hair between her sister's legs—so different from her own careful maintenance. Like looking at a version of herself she'd never allowed to exist.</p><p>Helly sits on the edge of the bed, spreading her legs slightly.</p><p>"Okay, well, I guess just… get on your knees or whatever."</p><p>Helena lowers herself to the floor, grateful for Helly's offhanded indifference. It's easier this way—easier to pretend she's just some inconvenient piece of furniture being moved around and not a girl kneeling in front of her sister's cunt. And if some part of her enjoys it more than she should, that's no one's business but hers.</p><p>Up close, she can see the pink flesh already glistening. The scent slams into her, ricocheting through her chest and crashing between her legs where her pulse begins to hammer with need.</p><p>"Well?" Helly says, leaning back on her elbows. "Are you gonna start or just stare at it all day?"</p><p>She tries to figure out where to begin. She leans forward tentatively, pressing a soft kiss to Helly's inner thigh.</p><p>"No, don't do that," Helly says with mild exasperation. "Just—don't be weird about it."</p><p>Right. Don't be weird about it. She adjusts her position, moving closer to where Helly wants her, ghosting her lips just above her clit.</p><p>"Yeah, there," Helly says. "Use your tongue."</p><p>Helena takes a shaky breath and extends her tongue, making contact with the edge of Helly's clit. The taste explodes across her senses—musky and bitter-sweet and completely Helly. She resists the pull to dive in completely, to bury her face in slickness. Instead, she traces a slow line with her tongue like she's asking a question.</p><p>Helly moans and sucks in air through her teeth. "Fuck, that's good." She threads her fingers through Helena's hair and pulls her in deeper, soaking her chin. "Little bit faster," she instructs. "And stay in one place for more than two seconds. You're all over the map."</p><p>Helly's correction drips with condescension, like she's training a particularly dim pet. Helena's cunt clenches around nothing. Of course she's failing, of course she needs to be taught how to be useful. She's exactly what Helly thinks she is—incompetent, needy, desperate to please. She adjusts her tongue obediently, chasing approval from the only person who's ever seen her clearly.</p><p>"There," Helly breathes, her fingers tightening in Helena's hair. "Just like that. Don't change anything."</p><p>Helena sinks into the rhythm, into the way Helly's thighs tremble against her skull. This is what she didn't have words for. This is what she's been craving without knowing it. To be useful. To be the source of Helly's pleasure. To have a purpose beyond her own desperate wanting.</p><p>She can't get over the taste flooding her mouth, thick and heady. She's starved for it, nose crushed against auburn curls as she gulps down the scent. It fills her lungs, coats her teeth, seeps into her tongue. She's drooling, spitting, lapping, can't even tell what's hers anymore. It's all Helly now. </p><p>"Fuck," Helly gasps above her, hips starting to move in small circles. "Keep doing exactly that."</p><p>Helena's jaw aches but she doesn't care. Short of it falling off, nothing could tear her off her sister's cunt. She laps at Helly's clit with careful, eager strokes, each one more confident than the last. She feels the wetness deepen, tastes the sharp change in pressure building. She'll earn this. She'll be a good girl and work for it until Helly comes.</p><p>"God, you're getting it everywhere," Helly mutters, but there's no real bite left. She's right—it is everywhere. Wetness coats Helena's face, drips down her neck, pools onto the sheets below. Helly tries to sound annoyed, but she's out of her mind too, maybe worse. They're both so deeply sick.</p><p>"I'm gonna come, like—really soon. Really soon," Helly repeats, her breath getting shallow. "Don't stop."</p><p>Helly's hand clamps down harder, like she's worried Helena might resist. Like she might try to escape, as if she would ever leave this perfect suffocation, choking on the mess she's making.</p><p>Helly comes with a strangled, guttural moan, thighs snapping around Helena's head like a vice. The pressure makes Helena's skull throb, her ears ring, but she doesn't dare pull away. Helly's hips buck against Helena's mouth, fingers tangled in hair like she's trying to fuse them together. Wetness floods Helena's mouth, hot and slick and endless. She laps it up like an animal, desperate not to miss a drop; her mouth never knew purpose before this.</p><p>Helly's grip on her hair finally loosens as she comes down, chest heaving with exhaustion. "Jesus," she pants. "That was... fuck."</p><p>Helena sits back on her heels, wiping her mouth with the back of her hand. Her face is soaked, chin and cheeks coated with Helly's release. She can still taste her sister on her tongue, can still smell her in every breath.</p><p>"Good?" Helena asks quietly.</p><p>Helly looks down at her with heavy-lidded eyes. "Yeah. Way better than I expected, honestly."</p><p>The casual praise makes Helena's chest flutter with pride, even as she tries to ignore how pathetic that makes her feel.</p><p>Helly starts laughing.</p><p>"What's so funny?" Helena asks, still kneeling between her sister's legs.</p><p>"You just look funny with your face all wet like that," Helly grins, reaching out to wipe Helena's chin with her thumb. "Like a messy little kid."</p><p>Helena's face burns. "Shut up."</p><p>Helly's expression shifts, becoming more curious. "So, why haven't you tried touching yourself since I showed you?"</p><p>"I don't know," Helena lies. She couldn't say the real reason is because, without question, her mind would drift to Helly.</p><p>"You really need to learn how," Helly says sternly. "I can't do it for you every time."</p><p>"I wasn't asking you to," Helena responds quickly, defensive.</p><p>Helly studies her for a moment, then shrugs. "Well, I guess just <em> one </em>more time is fair. One round of oral has to be worth at least two rounds of hands, right?"</p><p>Helena's heart leaps in her chest, but she forces her face to stay neutral. She can't believe her luck, can't believe Helly just offered to touch her again. And the math checks out again, doesn't it? She loves that about her big sister, how she always finds a way to make things make sense.</p><p>"I guess," Helena responds, trying to sound casual.</p><p>"Come here then," Helly says, patting the bed beside her.</p><p>Helena clambers up, swaying. Helly catches her, then presses her back down, yanking off her skirt and underwear in one fluid, unapologetic motion.</p><p>"This time I can get the angle right," Helly mutters, positioning herself over Helena. "Last time was awkward as hell."</p><p>Helena spreads her legs and lets Helly settle between them. She melts into the bed, head sinking into pillows that smell like Helly's shampoo, and gazes up with quiet awe. She's so lucky—so grateful—that she doesn't have to think. Doesn't have to try. Helly will take care of everything, just like always.</p><p>"You're soaked," Helly observes with clinical interest. "Getting me off really does it for you, huh?"</p><p>Before Helena can protest, Helly's already pushing two fingers inside her, deeper than she could manage from behind. The stretch makes Helena arch off the bed.</p><p>"There," Helly says with satisfaction, curling her fingers. "<em> That's </em>your G-spot. Feel the difference?"</p><p>Helena can only nod, overwhelmed by the intensity of it. Nothing like the fluttering sensation on her clit. This is deeper, heavier, filling her completely. Her body was made for this pressure, there's no room left for anything else—just Helly.</p><p>"You like that better, I can tell," Helly grins, watching Helena's face with fascination. "You take it so well. Such a little whore."</p><p>The name strips her bare. Helena's body trembles, too full to speak, too far gone to protest. Her cunt clenches helplessly around Helly's fingers, answering for her.</p><p>"I knew you'd like that," Helly smirks.</p><p>She's whimpering, babbling, stunned by how fast it's happening. Helly's fingers are so fucking long, hammering the spot she just learned existed. And her voice, soft and cruel, just pulls her closer to the edge.</p><p>"No way you're gonna come already," Helly mocks, but she doesn't slow her pace. "You need to learn some self-control or you're gonna embarrass yourself when you actually have sex."</p><p>Helena whines, trying desperately to pull back from the edge, but Helly's fingers are relentless inside her.</p><p>"You can't, can you?" Helly's tone softens. "It feels too good? That's okay, baby. Just let go."</p><p>She tries to hold on, tries to prove she has some control, but that does it. Her orgasm tears through her with violent intensity, and this time the angle sends her release gushing upward. It paints Helly's arm, soaks her shirt, even dots her face in warm, humiliating bursts.</p><p>"Jesus Christ," Helly says, blinking in surprise as Helena continues to convulse beneath her. "Oh my god, you're still going."</p><p>It's endless. She squeezes her eyes shut, begging her body to stop betraying her, but it won't listen. She's been seized—possessed—and Helly is the priest dragging the sin from her body. Her fingers work like a rite, exorcising her release. Helena lets it happen, soaks her sister in her corruption.</p><p>Finally, the waves subside, leaving Helena gasping and oversensitive. But instead of stopping, Helly keeps working her fingers, focusing on Helena's swollen clit with ruthless intensity. Helena tries to squirm away, but Helly uses her free hand to pin her hip down.</p><p>"Just try to take it," Helly whispers.</p><p>Helena can't speak, can barely breathe. It's painful, excruciating, but underneath it pulses a twisted pleasure that makes her body arch toward the torment.</p><p>Helly works her sore flesh like she's conducting an experiment, watching Helena's face with an almost detached curiosity, like she's testing the limits of her own reflection.</p><p>"You can barely handle it, can you? You're trying. I know you are."</p><p>Stars explode behind Helena's eyelids. The sensations are too much, too intense, walking the knife's edge between pleasure and torture. Tears pour down her face as she writhes helplessly, pinned under Helly's unforgiving touch.</p><p>"Stop," she finally gasps through her tears. "Please, I can't."</p><p>"Shh, you're okay," Helly slows her pace just enough to make it bearable. "You just came so fast, are you sure you want it to be over already?"</p><p>"Helly," she cries, her whole body thrashing. "It's too much."</p><p>"I'm sorry, baby," Helly pulls her hand away, mercifully. "My fingers are too rough, maybe?"</p><p>Helena gasps desperately, finally able to breathe again. She thinks it's over, done with, but Helly shuffles back toward the foot of the bed, leaning down to face Helena's cunt.</p><p>"God, everything's all fucking wet," Helly laughs. "I can't believe how much was in you."</p><p>Helena can't tell if the tears streaming down her face are from her last shred of dignity tearing away, or from the shockwaves that echo unabating through her body, refusing to fade with Helly's touch.</p><p>"I'll use my mouth, okay? It'll feel better, I promise," Helly assures her.</p><p>"You don't have to do that," she manages to choke out, quietly, wetly. She feels revolting, couldn't even hold her orgasm, couldn't handle Helly's fingers working her oversensitive flesh, and now her sister has to debase herself.</p><p>"I don't mind," Helly rubs her thighs. "I've always taken care of you."</p><p>Helena nods, sniffles. It's true, she has. She always has.</p><p>Helly leans forward and takes a long drag of her tongue up Helena's center. It's agony—maybe the worst thing she's ever felt. Painful and disgusting in equal parts. She needs more. She thinks it might kill her. She makes a horrible, broken sound.</p><p>"Who do you shave for anyway?" Helly mutters against her cunt. "You planning on fucking someone soon?"</p><p>Helena shakes her head. She can't form words.</p><p>"Good," Helly says between slow, deliberate drags from her entrance to the base of her clit. "You should wait for someone special, okay? Promise?"</p><p>Helena nods sporadically, out of rhythm. Helly always worries for her. Helly always cares. Helly always makes sure she gets the best, even when she hasn't earned it.</p><p>She moves her mouth around her clit and even that's too much, but then she darts the tip of her tongue against it and sucks gently. Helena can't stop the scream that tears from her throat. She writhes against the bed, limbs completely out of control. She tries to push Helly's head back but she can't even do that. She kicks her in the stomach instead—hard.</p><p>"Jesus," Helly coughs. "Okay, fine, we're done then. <em> Fuck</em>."</p><p>Helena tries to apologize but nothing coherent comes out, just a string of babbled syllables. Eventually, with effort, one word makes it through: "please."</p><p>"No, fuck you. Why'd you kick me?"</p><p>"I didn't—I didn't mean to," she pleads. Her body never listens, only fails in ways that Helly pays for.</p><p>Helly sits back on her heels, and for a terrifying second, Helena thinks she's about to leave.</p><p>"Wait—" Helena begs. "Please. Please come back."</p><p>Helly stares at her for a long moment, jaw working like she's chewing on something bitter. Finally, she lets out an exaggerated sigh.</p><p>"Fine, Helena," she says, settling back between her sister's legs with obvious reluctance. Her name lands like a blow, but she deserves the disdain. Her sister shouldn't have to clean up her messes, shouldn't have to touch her disgusting, broken body just because she can't control herself.</p><p>"I know," Helena whispers. "I know you shouldn't have to—"</p><p>"But I will," Helly cuts her off. "I just wish you appreciated it more—what I do for you."</p><p>The guilt crashes over Helena in waves. She's selfish, demanding, a burden that Helly has carried their entire lives. Always needing to be taken care of, always too weak to handle things on her own. She doesn't deserve Helly's patience, doesn't deserve her touch, doesn't deserve anything good at all.</p><p>When Helly's mouth finds her again, the pleasure burns like acid. Helena endures it, lets it corrode her. The pain is perfect, actually. Perfectly calibrated for someone as twisted as she is. She can't have normal pleasure, gentle touches—<em>no</em>, she gets this instead. Overstimulation sharp enough to skin her alive. It's what she deserves for refusing to face the rot inside her; now ecstasy can only arrive wearing the face of suffering.</p><p>"You're close again already," Helly mutters, slickness coating her lips, finger resting just barely inside Helena like a sensor. "You just can't hold it, can you? It's alright. You can come."</p><p>Her climax hits, swift and brutal. Her whole body convulses as she squirts onto Helly's face, harder than last time. It seems to go on forever, but Helly doesn't move, doesn't flinch away. She stays exactly where she is, letting Helena's release wash over her face, coating her cheeks and dripping down her chin.</p><p>She falls back gasping, body shaking, dimly aware that she's sobbing from the intensity. She wants to vanish, but disappearing is a luxury she hasn't earned. She's defiled everything—Helly's bed, Helly's body, <em> Helly</em>. The ugliness she spent her whole life burying finally spilled out; the least she can do is face it.</p><p>She lay there, open and willing, offering herself up as penance, welcoming Helly's wrath like a sacrament.</p><p>But it doesn't come. Instead, she feels a gentle hand on her wrist, fingers slipping into the clasp of her own. Her sister pulls her upright from the soiled bed and lets her lean her wobbly body against her side.</p><p>"Come on, let's go to your bed," Helly says softly, walking her over. "I'll clean that up later, I guess."</p><p>"I'm so sorry," Helena whispers. "I'm so sorry I'm like this."</p><p>Helly lays her back on her own bed gently and presses a soft kiss to her forehead. She peels off her own ruined shirt and wipes her face with it. She drops it carelessly, then flops on top of Helena with theatrical weight, nuzzling into the curve of her neck.</p><p>"You're so fucking funny," she says, her voice laced with fondness Helena can't bear to believe is meant for her, even as she clings to it like air.</p><p>Helly sighs contentedly as she settles her weight on top of her. Helena feels so crushed, so safe, so completely folded into Helly that the edges start to blur. She wonders if she could fuse with her—if that would fix her. If Helly could burrow inside, scoop out the rot, and leave her clean. Maybe then she would finally feel whole.</p><p>"Hey," Helly whispers, her breath tickling Helena's ear. "You know you owe me one now, right?"</p><p><br />

          <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>I've had so much fun writing fic for this fandom the past few months (especially my beloved hellyna twincest), but I am unfortunately starting to feel a little burned out 😭 I am going to take a little break. I want to finish Covenant, but it will probably be a while before I write the next chapter- I really love that story and want to make sure I don't get sloppy about it.</p><p>In the meantime, please check out all of the new twincest fics in the tag!! We've had such a hellyna renaissance lately. Who else remembers when there were only 2 twincest fics?? I love this fandom so much. We take our yuri seriously 😤</p></blockquote>
