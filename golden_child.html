    <h2 class="toc-heading">golden child</h2>
    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>
  <span>She's eight years old and shaking, partly from the dampness seeping through her nightgown, but mostly from the effort of holding back tears. It's happened again. The shameful thing she's entirely too old to be doing. What she can't control and can't seem to figure out how to stop.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She knows what's coming. The welts from last time are still tender beneath her fingertips, raised lines that haven't yet faded. She traces them carefully, pressing just enough to make them sting. As if punishing herself might somehow satisfy the debt, spare her from what waits in Father's hands.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She grits her teeth and rolls over, wincing at the squelch beneath her legs. Her sister lies in the next bed, fast asleep, peaceful. Helly never wets the bed. They're supposed to be the same—so why is she the only one that's broken?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She doesn't know what to do. It's the third time this month, the worst it's ever been. She's tried everything. No water past five. Skipped dinners. Prayers in the morning, prayers at night. She follows every rule. Every ritual. Every bite of the tongue. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She's the perfect daughter.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But it won't stop.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A sob tears up her throat before she can swallow it down, ragged and small, but enough. The sound barely escapes, but Helly stirs. Maybe it didn't even reach her ear. Maybe she just felt it, the way she always does.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her sister turns in her bed, still half-asleep, and reaches out without opening her eyes. Helena doesn't have words for what this is yet, only the feeling: Helly will always know, and Helly will always come.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Helly grumbles, rubbing the sleep out of her eyes. "Did it happen again?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I'm sorry," Helena whispers. "I'm sorry," she repeats, a bit louder, like saying it hard enough will make it stop.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Helly drags herself out of bed and stumbles across the room. It's not graceful. She moves like something pulled from deep water, heavy-limbed and dazed. Sleep clings to her, thick as fog. She's always been hard to wake.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Helly wipes the tears from her sister's eyes. "I thought you were gonna stop drinking water before bed."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I did," Helena sniffles, sitting up. She climbs out of her own mess and drops onto the floor. "I don't know how it happened."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Helly clicks on the lamp beside her. "Jeez," she mutters, wincing. "There's a lot."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The humiliation hits all at once, burning. There is a lot. Helena doesn't understand how it could've come from her, how her own body could turn against her like this. It feels like divine punishment. Like there's something wrong with her, deep down, rotten, and no one will tell her what.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She doesn't want the belt again. She knows Helly knows she doesn't want the belt again. Sometimes Helena wonders if she can feel each lash like it's splitting them both open, old scars tearing back to life. Helly never flinches when it happens, when she's watching, but afterward, she's always there. A steady presence, trying to take some of it with her. Helena knows she'd carry it all if she could.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She's glad she doesn't have to. There's comfort in that, at least—that it's happening to her, not her sister.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Maybe we don't have to tell him this time," Helly suggests. "We can hide it."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"How?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Helly begins stripping Helena's bedding. Helena shrinks as she sees how far it spread, how much soaked through to the mattress, how the sodden material slaps wet against Helly's bare arms. But Helly doesn't seem to care. She moves with quiet focus, unbothered, stoic in her rescue. There's something almost paternal in it, the love and the calm. Like she's done this a hundred times and will do it a hundred more, and none of it could ever make her turn away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She trots out of the bedroom, the bundle of bedding nearly swallowing her whole. She's dwarfed beneath it, arms wrapped tight around the unwieldy bundle, waddling blindly down the staircase. It would be amusing, borderline hilarious, if it weren't so raw. If the act weren't so earnest, so sacred, so impossibly pure.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Helena stands in the laundry room doorway, shivering, bare feet cold on the tile. She watches as Helly fumbles with the machine, stretching on her toes to reach the lid, pushing it open with both hands. She moves with the blind faith of someone who trusts the world will take care of her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You know how to do that?" Helena asks, voice hoarse, scraped dry from thirst.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I've seen Joanne do it."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Helena's never thought to look at what their housekeeper does, let alone learn from it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Helly quietly shuts the lid and twists the dial until the red light clicks on.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It's gonna take a while," Helly says. "Maybe an hour?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Helena sneaks back upstairs and cleans up. She pulls on a clean pair of pajamas and a sweatshirt that used to be her mother's. It still smells like her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When she returns, Helly is standing at the kitchen sink, quietly washing her arms with the sprayer. She moves with a patience rarely seen, rinsing until the chill brings goosebumps to her skin. She doesn't complain.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They tiptoe across the halls. The house feels cavernous at night, far too big for two little girls. Every creak threatens to give them away. It feels like the walls are listening, like the house itself is holding its breath, waiting to swallow them whole if they're not careful.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They settle in the living room on the stiff leather couch. Its cold surface makes Helly shiver. Helena shifts closer, letting their arms touch. An offering of warmth; the least she can do. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Helly grabs the remote and mutes the TV before turning it on, then scrolls until she finds something with bright colors. They watch cartoons in silence, pretending to enjoy it. Pretending it's worth whatever punishment might come if they're caught. Helena doesn't follow the plot. She just listens to the washer spinning in the distance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After a while, Helly rests her head on Helena's shoulder. Helena blinks. Her throat tightens, dry and raw, sticking to itself. She doesn't lean into Helly, not sure she deserves to. Not sure someone so rotten should be so loved. But Helly stays there, quiet and still and present. Of course she does.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maybe she knows how badly Helena needs it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maybe she hopes that love can teach the body what punishment never could. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They sit like that until the washer clicks off.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This is the last night it ever happens.</span>
</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p align="center">
  <span>✲</span>
</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>
  <span>She's fourteen years old and she wants to fucking die. She stares at it like it might shift in front of her eyes from sheer will alone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>B-.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She's never gotten anything less than an A. Not once in her life. She's made sure of it. Fought tooth and nail for it. Controlled every variable to keep this exact thing from happening.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And yet—here it is. Staring back at her. Unmoving. Indifferent to her shame. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Helly sidles up next to her at the locker, peeks at the grade, and whistles. "Told you that bio test was a bitch."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Father is going to kill me."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Nah," Helly shrugs. "I've gotten worse. Just don't show him."</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Just don't show him.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>How easy it must be to be Helly. To live in the long shadow of the panopticon instead of dead center. To be just far enough from the eye that it's possible to pretend no one's watching.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Helena doesn't respond. She's tired of this argument. Tired of all the arguments, really. Tired of trying to explain why they're different when all she wants is for them to be the same again. Or maybe not again. They never were—but back then, it felt closer than whatever this is now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Later that night, she shows him. She doesn't have a choice. Better to get it over with now than face the punishment for the grade </span>
  <em>
    <span>and </span>
  </em>
  <span>for hiding it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It's not always physical anymore. It doesn't have to be. Father had figured out that the damage he could do to her mind lasted longer than anything he could leave on her skin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He looks at the paper with a quiet disappointment. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I expected more," he starts. "Helly has never brought home anything less than an A."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her brow quirks, slightly. The most emotion she can show and get away with. What she really feels coils low in her stomach, something between a laugh and a gag. Helly doesn't even try. She floats, stumbles, hides the evidence and gets away with it. Helena does almost everything right and still gets dragged across the coals.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her own fault, she supposes. Almost isn't good enough.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Father dismisses her and she wonders why she's off the hook.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The next day, her school photo is gone from the mantle. Helly's is front and center.</span>
</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p align="center">
  <span>✲</span>
</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>
  <span>She's fifteen years old and it's all her fault. She wonders if she'd just studied a little bit harder, maybe none of this would've happened. If she would've taken Helly's advice and just </span>
  <em>
    <span>hid </span>
  </em>
  <span>that stupid fucking B- from over a year ago, maybe she would've gotten away with it. Or maybe she would've gotten caught and drawn more of Father's anger then—let him get it all out of his system.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Instead, she watches Helly leave his den, broken in a way she's never seen before. It's in her eyes, distant and glazed. She won't come back from whatever happened in there. Helena knows that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She'll never know what Father did. Helly won't say. Just like Helena has never said a word about all the private punishments she's endured. But she was supposed to carry it alone—and she had. For their entire lives. Fifteen full, heavy, impossible years.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Until tonight.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Helly drags out a chair and sits in front of her at the kitchen table, alone, except for the help—always hovering, always seemingly indifferent. But Helena knows who pays them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Hey," Helena says simply. What else is there to say? She's not built to offer the comfort she's received from Helly over the years. Doesn't have the instinct. She doesn't even try, spares them both the embarrassment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Helly doesn't respond. Just chews the inside of her cheek, picks at her nails. Whatever happened to her in there must have been worse, somehow, than everything Helena's been through combined. Or maybe Helly's just worse at handling it. Maybe the contrast of going untouched for so long only to be torn open all at once made it that much harder to swallow.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Whatever it is, it isn't fair. And it's all her fault.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For fourteen years, Helly had the luxury of being the favorite without the weight that came with it. Helena was the one with the title—the heiress, named successor to Lumon at twelve—but even then, she knew it wasn't real. It could be taken away the moment she slipped. That's all it ever was: a leash dressed as a crown. A way to free Helly and keep Helena in place. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>One biology test. One sanctimonious, lopsided exam from a teacher too naive to imagine the kind of punishment that could be waiting at home, too proud to consider that some students don't have the privilege of anything less than perfection, changed everything.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Now Helly bears the role Helena was trained to survive while Helena watches as a ghost.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This, too, is a punishment—for her and her alone. Helly is just collateral. She was never built to carry it. Not like Helena. And that's the point.</span>
</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p align="center">
  <span>✲</span>
</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>
  <span>She's sixteen years old and completely alone. Helly barely looks at her anymore. When she does, her eyes are empty of the warmth that used to live there, warped into something Helena recognizes but never thought she'd see aimed at her—not from her Helly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It's in the small cruelties now. The way Helly's shoulder turns just slightly when Helena enters a room. The careful distance maintained at dinner, as if Helena's very presence is contaminating. Sometimes Helena catches her sister watching with an expression so cold it makes her chest tight. Disdain, pure and uncomplicated. The kind reserved for things beneath contempt.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Helena knows she deserves it. She's back on the mantle now, her photo restored to its place of honor like a false idol. The golden child again, through no choice of her own. She wants to tell Helly it means nothing, that the title is just another trap, another way to pit them against each other. But she knows Helly won't hear it now. Father has rewired something fundamental between them—turned love into suspicion, protection into rivalry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She misses Helly terribly. Misses her with the kind of ache that sits heavy in her bones and drills into her marrow, hollowing her out from the inside. The sister who once stood between her and the darkness has been swallowed by it. The cruelty Helly once helped her survive has taken root in her, transformed her into something unrecognizable. Helena watches it happen like watching someone drown in slow motion—close enough to see every desperate gasp, too far to reach. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She deserves to be alone. For failing to shield Helly the way Helly once shielded her. For being unable to return that sacred gift when it actually mattered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But god, she fucking misses her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Helly sits at the table, focused on her homework, chewing the top of her pencil like it might offer some reprieve. Pink shavings scatter across the page—evidence of her struggle. Her grades are bad and getting worse. The pressure that forms Helena into a diamond crumbles Helly into dust. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Helena peaks over her shoulder. "If you calculate the area first, you can work backwards to get the missing side."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Helly scoffs. "No shit."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Okay, sorry," Helena frowns. "What are you stuck on then?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I'm </span>
  <em>
    <span>not </span>
  </em>
  <span>stuck," Helly's head snaps up to look at her. "Can you please stop hovering? I can't focus with you watching me."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Helena, stop distracting your sister," Father says, stepping into the room with a dress suspended in a sheer garment bag.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her body reacts before her mind can catch up—an instant recoil, muscle memory carved deep from years of conditioning. She takes three measured steps back, the precise distance she's learned keeps her just outside his immediate reach. Safe, if such a thing exists in this house.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Father doesn't like them talking to each other. The rule has never been spoken aloud, but it hangs in the air like a whiff of something burning. Every moment of connection is a potential infraction. He's turned what little love is left between them into contraband, something to be hidden and hoarded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He hands Helena the dress.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What's this?" she asks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"The innovation showcase this Saturday," he responds, his tone suggesting this is a gift rather than a command. She knows better. "I'd like you to speak there. Show them what you've been working on."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her heart plummets. Saturday. Three days from now. Her schedule is already strangling her—AP classes, swim team, violin practice, SAT prep. Now this. Another performance, another tightrope to walk in front of his colleagues. She'll have to craft something brilliant from nothing, make it seem effortless, make him proud. Or at least not disappointed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The weight of the bag settles into her hands like a stone. Another impossible task wrapped in the pretense of opportunity, one she's supposed to be grateful for.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Thank you," she says quietly, smiling tightly. Anything to get him to leave her alone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It works. He retreats, satisfied with her performance, leaving Helena holding three days of sleepless nights in a garment bag. She wonders if diamonds ever crack under enough pressure, if there's a breaking point even for things compressed into brilliance. When she looks up, her sister is watching her with an expression that makes Helena's chest tighten. It's more than anger—the kind of rage that seems to surprise even Helly, something that escaped before she could stop it. Helena recognizes the fear flickering behind it. The feeling of losing yourself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She doesn't have time to think about it.</span>
</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p align="center">
  <span>✲</span>
</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>
  <span>She changes into the dress in her room, sliding the fabric over her sharp angles, just to check the fit. Not necessary. It fits just right—of course it does. Father knows her measurements like data points on a spreadsheet, tracks them with the same precision he tracks quarterly earnings. The dress hugs her exactly where it should, no alterations needed. She should be growing still, at sixteen, but she's learned to survive on so little that her body has simply stopped trying. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The dress is beautiful, though. Dark green silk that brushes her skin like a warm breath, with delicate beading along the neckline that catches the light. The kind of dress that makes her look older, more sophisticated. Exactly what he wants her to project at these events. She runs her fingers along the fabric, feeling its extravagant weight, the careful construction. For a moment, she allows herself to appreciate it. Father's gifts are double-edged, but they're always exquisite. He knows exactly how to dress his doll for display.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She doesn't take it off right away. One small luxury she allows herself; the feeling of something beautiful while she drowns in calculus and European history. She settles at her desk, careful not to wrinkle it. There's something defiant about doing homework in a dress meant for public consumption—stealing a private moment from something that was never meant to be hers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She loses herself in the work, the familiar rhythm of problems and essays. Time compresses the way it does when she's focused. Minutes become hours, the ache in her bladder the only marker of how long she's been hunched over her textbooks. She ignores the ache turning sharp, promising herself she’ll go after one more solved derivative, one more paragraph about war-torn economies…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She's deep in an essay about the Marshall Plan when she senses the shift in air. She looks up to find Helly leaning against her door frame.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Nice dress," Helly says. The rage from earlier is still there, just quieter now. Thinly veiled, suppressed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh." Helena's hand goes to the fabric reflexively, suddenly hyperaware of how it must look sitting here in silk while Helly struggles downstairs. She hadn't meant to keep it on this long. Hadn't meant for Helly to see. "Yeah, it's... fine."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The word lands awkwardly between them. Too dismissive and Helly will think she's ungrateful, playing down her privileges. Too enthusiastic and she's rubbing salt in the wound. Every interaction has become a minefield, and Helena can feel herself stepping wrong already.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Helly scoffs. "I didn't know you were working on something for the showcase."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I'm not," Helena shrugs. "He just threw that at me today."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Helly's eyes narrow. "Bullshit."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You're always sucking up to him," Helly pushes off the door frame, voice rising with each word. "Always trying to one-up me. And now you just </span>
  <em>
    <span>happen </span>
  </em>
  <span>to have a presentation ready?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The accusation hits Helena like a bucket of cold water. She wants to explain she'll be up for the next three nights frantically creating something from nothing. That </span>
  <em>
    <span>sucking up</span>
  </em>
  <span> is just survival, the same thing Helly used to understand without words. But she can see it won't matter. In Helly's eyes, every perfect grade, every measured response, every moment Helena doesn't crumble is a betrayal.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She's tired. So deeply, bone-achingly tired. She closes her textbook and stands, moving toward the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Helly blocks it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Fucking answer me." The rage is back in full swing, mask completely abandoned. Helena can't tell if Helly's lost control or simply let go. Either way, her sister fills the doorframe, hands braced against both sides. The same hands that once held her tenderly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Helly, please. Just move, I have to pee," Helena keeps her voice soft, reasonable. She lets surrender show in her eyes. She doesn't want this battle, already fighting on too many fronts.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But Helly doesn't budge. If anything, Helena's gentleness seems to make it worse, like submission is just another form of superiority. Another way Helena gets to be the good one while Helly burns.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I'm not moving until you tell me why you keep going behind my back," Helly says, feet planted. "What the fuck happened to you?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The answer is so absurdly obvious she almost laughs. The same thing that happened to Helly, just stretched across sixteen years instead of one. The only difference is that Helena carved the rules into her bones before she knew there was another way to be. They're both just trying to survive this place. Helena's crime, apparently, is being better at it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I don't know," she settles on. It's not entirely inaccurate. She knows the root, but the branching paths that led to her particular rot twist deep underground, tangled and half-lost in the dark.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You're such a fucking cunt. You know that?" Helly spits, nearly shaking now. "Too good to have a conversation anymore?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I'm just tired," she sighs, frustration creeping in despite her best efforts. "And I really have to pee, can you just move?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Something shifts in Helly's face. A darkness that goes deeper than rage, colder than disdain. For a moment, Helena doesn't recognize her sister at all. This isn't her Helly—not the girl who held her through nightmares or cleaned her shame without complaint. This is someone else entirely. Someone who's been pushed so far past the breaking point that there's nothing left to break, just jagged edges where a person used to be.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She doesn't have time to process the primal fear that floods her system before Helly lunges. They hit the carpet hard, Helena's reflexes barely saving her skull from cracking against the floor. The silk dress twists around her legs, trapping her as effectively as Helly's weight.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Jesus—what the fuck Helly?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You fucking bitch," Helly screams, face hovering an inch above hers. "It's not enough that you took everything from me?" Her thigh slams between Helena's legs, grinding into her core, pressing down on her bladder. "Now you parade it around in my face too?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Helena squirms, helpless, unable to break free. Helly has twenty pounds on her, at least. Most of it muscle. She can barely even speak.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What the fuck are you doing?" Helena chokes out, breath hitching. The two pressures are sharp, unbearable. Her body's signals tangle into something confusing and urgent, pain mixing with other sensations she doesn't want to name. Everything is too much at once, wires crossing in ways that make her feel both desperate and deeply, disgracefully exposed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Go ahead," Helly says, smiling darkly. "Piss yourself. Piss your pretty little dress."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Get off of me." Helena can't even believe what she's hearing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I know you can't hold it," Helly's almost laughing now. "You've never been able to."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reality slams her with force. This isn't a cruel joke. Helly's serious—she's actually going to make her do this. Panic floods every nerve, coming from too many directions at once. The shame of the act itself, that old humiliation she thought she'd escaped at eight years old. The inevitable, unimaginable punishment waiting when Father sees his expensive silk dress ruined. But worse than all of it—the person doing this to her. The one person in the world who knew how deep the wound ran, who held her through it, who made it bearable, turning around and using it as a weapon.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Helena's body trembles with the effort of holding not just her bladder, but everything. Tears, words, the scream building in her throat. She searches Helly's face for any trace of the sister who protected her, but finds only satisfaction in her struggle. The betrayal is so complete it feels like drowning.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And underneath it all, underneath the layers of shame that stack themselves like sediment, blooms a new seam, darker than bedrock, more poisonous than anything that seeps from above.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pleasure.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The recognition hits her like nausea. What fundamental brokenness must live inside her to find anything but horror in this moment? She's worse than she ever imagined. More rotten than even Father knows. The shame multiplies, feeding on itself—shame for what's happening, shame for how her body responds, shame for the sick part of her that doesn't want Helly to stop.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She moans.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It escapes before she can stop it, involuntary as breathing. The sound hangs between them, undeniable. She meets Helly's eyes, bracing for the reaction to her sickness.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Helly just laughs. It's the most and least human she's looked all night. There's mirth in it, but it's the kind that comes from somewhere hollowed out, echoing in empty spaces where empathy used to live.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Of course," Helly says, still laughing. "Of course you would."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Helly's leg drills deeper into her abdomen, deeper into her core. Helena writhes beneath her, desperate, using the pressure of Helly's thigh against her center to hold back the aching, impossible need to pee. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You're so fucking depraved," Helly's voice is so hoarse it barely lands above a whisper. "You're really gonna come from this, aren't you?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Please," Helena chokes out a sob. "Why are you doing this?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The pain is sharp, blinding—she feels like she's about to burst.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She feels like she's about to come.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Both happen at once.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It's so overwhelming she can't even tell the difference. Just a rush, a release, her body seizing and unraveling in the same breath. She arches off the floor with a strangled cry, limbs jerking, back bowing into Helly's weight as heat floods out of her. Her vision whites out. She's shaking, panting, drooling—some feral, undone thing caught between ecstasy and ruin. There's no control left, no dignity, no line between what was forced and what she wanted. Just pressure giving way, nerves shattering, and the sick, dizzy euphoria of not being able to stop. Of not wanting to.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Helly doesn't move. She just watches, lips parted. Taking it all in. Letting it all splash against her leg. "You're disgusting," she whispers, so faint it barely hits the air.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>By the time Helena comes down, she's still pissing. Still leaking hard and fast, her body unspooling like it doesn't belong to her anymore. She makes a weak, trembling attempt to stop it, to clench down, to salvage what little control she has left—but it's useless. The flood won't stop. Her muscles are spent, her dignity already gone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So she lets it happen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lets it all pour out onto the floor, hot and endless, soaking through her dress, onto Helly, into everything. Shame and relief bleeding together until she can't tell which is worse.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You still going?" Helly asks, unable to hide the rush in her eyes. The sick pleasure she takes in this too.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Helena lets out a shaky breath, nods.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Helly's weight settles heavier on her. "Good."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Helena can feel Helly's breath on her face, her sister's short pants turning more erratic with each passing second. She searches those familiar eyes and finds her there again. Her Helly. Corrupted, twisted, swallowed by the depths—but hers. Even now, even like this, there's an intimacy to it that breaks her heart.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When she finishes, when there's nothing left to leak out of her, she doesn't tell Helly. She stays quiet, still, hoping to stretch whatever this is a little longer. Just to feel the weight of Helly's body on top of hers. The warmth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Helly's breath ghosts across her lips with each exhale. Helena catches her own bottom lip between her teeth, tastes the humid air between them, and the surge that follows is perverse in its intensity. She wants Helly. Wants her in every way a person can want someone—protector and tormentor, sister and scourge, the source of both salvation and damnation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The absurdity of discovering this now, lying in a puddle of her own piss, the want drawn out by the very person it all revolves around, fractures something fundamental within her. She finds the bottom of her own depravity and discovers it goes deeper still.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Helena cranes her neck, tilts her head just enough for her lips to brush her sister's. The kiss barely registers—a brief, trembling contact—before Helly jerks away like she's been stung.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What the fuck?" Helly's voice is dry, breathless. She quickly stands, looming over Helena, her thigh still soaking wet. "Why would you do that?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The question is laughable, of course. As if this, of all things, is the line that matters. Helena can't find a way through the noise in her head, thoughts ricocheting, crashing into each other. All that's left is the instinct that rules her—small, silent, waiting to be punished.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I don't know," she says, barely above a whisper. "Sorry."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Helly looks down at what she's done. Her chin quivers, her eyes go wide, she flexes her fingers as if she's looking for something to hold onto. The rage drains from her face so fast it leaves her looking hollow, younger suddenly. Lost.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Fuck," she whispers. "Fuck," she says again, louder. "Helena, I—" The sentence dies in her throat. Her hands come up to cover the lower half of her face, and she just stares. Helena watches something shift behind her sister's eyes. The terrible clarity that comes after violence. The look of someone surveying ruins that used to be home, knowing they're the one who burned it down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It's fine," Helena says quickly, trying to cut off whatever comes next in Helly's spiral.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh my god," Helly breathes. With each passing second, more of herself seems to return—and with it, the full weight of what she's done.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Helly, it's fine," Helena repeats, standing to survey the damage. The dress is ruined, silk torn and stained beyond saving. The carpet is sodden, the stain blooming wider with every second. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The punishment from Father is looming. It strikes her how little that matters now. The most precious thing ruined lies in the space between them, invisible and irreparable. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The last thread of what they used to be to each other, already stripped to the barest fiber—finally severed.</span>
