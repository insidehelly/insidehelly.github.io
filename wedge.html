<div class="userstuff">
  <p>“Miss Eagan.”</p><p>Helena sat upright in the straight-backed chair, hands folded in her lap, eyes on the floor. She didn’t dare look directly at Headmistress Cobel, though she could feel the woman’s gaze bearing down on her like a sunlamp, searching for rot.</p><p>“I don’t believe you understand the position you’re in,” Cobel said at last, voice calm and clipped. “Or perhaps you’ve simply forgotten.”</p><p>Helena blinked once, slowly. The silence stretched between them.</p><p>“I’m sorry, ma’am.”</p><p>Cobel stood, rounding the desk with the slow precision of someone who enjoyed walking in circles around her prey. Her heels clicked sharply on the tile.</p><p>“You were <em> dozing</em>. In Economics.”</p><p>Helena flinched. She hadn’t meant to. That was the worst part.</p><p>“I wasn’t sleeping,” she said, too softly.</p><p>“Oh no?” Cobel’s voice curled like steam. “Then what should we call it, when the heiress to Lumon Industries closes her eyes mid-lecture and ceases to respond to direct questions?”</p><p>Cobel’s steps slowed behind her.</p><p>“You represent more than yourself, Miss Eagan. You know that, don’t you?”</p><p>Helena’s fingers twitched in her lap.</p><p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p><p>“Your sister made her stance clear. She doesn’t want to be here. That’s unfortunate — and disappointing — but not unexpected.”</p><p>Cobel moved to stand directly in front of her now, leaning over. Helena could see a bead of sweat beginning to form between her brows. </p><p>“But <em> you</em>,” Cobel continued, “you are meant to uphold the legacy. You are meant to embody <em> discipline </em>.”</p><p>Helena’s face burned. She wanted to disappear into the floor. She wanted to cry. She wanted to ask why <em> she </em> had to be the one. Why Helly was the only one of the two with the courage to tell their father <em> no</em>. With the respect to get away with it.</p><p>“I really am sorry.”</p><p>Cobel’s eyes didn’t move from hers.</p><p>“You don’t get to be sorry,” she said. “You get to be exemplary. You get to be <em> worthy</em>.”</p><p>She let that word hang in the air — heavy, poisonous.</p><p>Helena didn’t speak. She couldn’t.</p><p>“You think I don’t know what this is?” Cobel asked, straightening, folding her hands behind her back. “A cry for attention? A silent protest? You’re not your sister, Helena. Don’t insult us both by pretending you are.”</p><p>The office was spinning now. She clenched her jaw. Crinkled her nose ever-so-slightly.</p><p>“I expect a written apology to your instructor,” Cobel continued, already moving back toward her desk. “And starting tomorrow, you’ll report to your morning lectures fifteen minutes early to help prepare the space. Restore order.”</p><p>Helena nodded once, mechanical. “Yes, ma’am.”</p><p>“Dismissed.”</p><p>⟡</p><p>The hallway lights hummed overhead, cold and constant. Helena walked the length of the corridor with her hands clasped behind her back — posture upright, pace even. A model student, even in disgrace.</p><p>She reached the door of her dormitory, swiped her key card, and stepped inside. The room was dim — the single window tinted blue with the beginnings of twilight. Natalie was at her desk, reading with the military stillness she always had during quiet hours. She didn’t look up. She never did.</p><p>Helly was on her bed. Or rather, draped across it — on her stomach, boots still on, cheek pressed into the crook of her arm. Her hair was unbrushed. Her blazer had fallen half off her shoulder. She was asleep. </p><p>Helena was surprised she was back so early, breaking their usual routine. Usually, Helly came back late, after Helena had already turned in and was fast asleep. Then, Helena would wake before dawn — slipping out for her morning shower while Helly was still dead to the world, limbs tangled in the sheets.</p><p>Seeing each other sleep was the only contact they had left.</p><p>It hadn’t always been like this.</p><p>When they were children, back at the estate, they shared everything. They were the kind of close that made strangers uneasy — twin girls speaking in looks and silences, curled together like nesting dolls. Communicating in their own language. Living in their own world.</p><p>Even their first year at the academy had been like that — an unspoken alliance in a place full of watchful eyes. But the older they got, the more the system worked to pry them apart. Different schedules. Different electives. “Balanced development,” they’d called it. “Fostering independence.”</p><p>By seventeen, they rarely sat in the same classes. By eighteen, they were barely acknowledged as siblings — just two students with the same last name and shared dorm assignment.</p><p>Now, at nineteen, they were little more than ghosts to each other.</p><p>Helena stood at the foot of the bed for a moment, just watching her. Helly’s mouth twitched slightly in her sleep. She looked younger like this. Softer. Like the girl Helena used to know.</p><p>Then she stirred. Groaned softly. Shifted onto her side. Her eyes fluttered open. They locked onto Helena.</p><p>“…Hey,” Helly said, voice rough with sleep.</p><p>Helena swallowed. “Hi.”</p><p>Helly pushed herself up onto her elbows, blinking hard, her hair falling across her face.</p><p>“You’re never home this early,” Helena said, voice barely above a murmur.</p><p>“Didn’t want to miss you tonight.” She stretched lazily, spine arched like a cat, then sat upright. “You look like shit.”</p><p>Helena offered a flat smile. “Thanks.”</p><p>A pause.</p><p>Helly rubbed at one eye with the heel of her palm, then glanced toward Natalie. Still reading. Still silent. A sentry in civilian clothes.</p><p>“I heard through the grapevine that <em> Helena Eagan </em> got in trouble today,” Helly teased, a smirk creeping up the side of her face.</p><p>Helena hesitated. The second to last thing she wanted was to get into it. To relive the shame and embarrassment their father had trained her to feel when she was anything less than perfect. </p><p>The last thing she wanted was for her first conversation with Helly in over a week to end.</p><p>“I fell asleep in class.”</p><p>Helly’s eyebrows raised. Just slightly.</p><p>“Economics?”</p><p>Helena nodded.</p><p>Helly snorted. “Told you that class was boring.”</p><p>“I really didn’t mean to,” Helena said quickly. “I just— I closed my eyes for a second.”</p><p>Helly shrugged. “You don’t have to explain it to me.”</p><p>Another beat passed.</p><p>Helena moved to the foot of her bed and sat down slowly, facing away. “You know,” she said after a long pause, “you don’t have to avoid me.”</p><p>Helly looked up, confused. “I’m not avoiding you,” she said, sounding a bit offended. “You’re just never here.”</p><p>“<em>You’re </em>never here.”</p><p>Helly’s shoulders tensed. She didn’t answer right away. She glanced at Natalie, still pretending to read. Always there. Always listening.</p><p>“I’m a bad influence,” Helly said, choosing her words carefully. “It’s probably better if you don’t hang around me. Especially with you going to the company next month.”</p><p>Her eyes told a different story — locked on Helena, heavy with the same silent plea she’d made a hundred times before: <em> stay. Tell him no. Come with me. </em></p><p>Helena knew that look. She’d turned it down every time. Tonight was no different.</p><p>“You could still come to Lumon, you know,” Helena offered. “Father would be thrilled to have his favorite back by his side.”</p><p>Helly rolled her eyes. “You couldn’t get me back there with a gun to my head.”</p><p>This was how their rare conversations always ended lately — circling the same disagreement. A connection that had once been effortless now felt like talking to a brick wall.</p><p>A piece of Helena’s soul was quietly rotting away.</p><p>⟡</p><p>Helena’s eyes opened to darkness. She wasn’t sure what had woken her — a shift in the air, the weight of a dream, the pressure behind her eyes that never seemed to fully go away anymore.</p><p>The room was still. Dead silent. But then she saw movement, subtle, just at the edge of her vision. She turned her head.</p><p>Helly.</p><p>Lying in bed across from her, back arched slightly, legs parted beneath the thin blanket. One hand moving in a slow, rhythmic motion under the covers.</p><p>Helena’s breath caught. She should have looked away. She didn’t.</p><p>Helly’s face was tilted up toward the ceiling, her eyes half-lidded, lashes fluttering faintly with each breath. Her lips were parted. Her chest rose and fell in unsteady rhythm.</p><p>Helena’s stomach twisted. A flicker of heat pulsed low in her core.</p><p>She should turn away. Shut her eyes. <em> Go back to sleep. </em></p><p>But her gaze stayed locked. She couldn’t move.</p><p>The blanket shifted slightly with the motion of Helly’s hand — gentle, deliberate. Helena could see the way her thigh twitched every so often. The way her lips pressed together as she tried to stay quiet. Tried not to get caught. Tried to enjoy a private moment for herself.</p><p>Helena’s mouth went dry.</p><p>And then Helly turned her head towards Helena. Locked her gaze onto hers. Looked like a deer in the headlights.</p><p>For one suspended second, neither of them moved.</p><p>Helena felt every nerve in her body ignite. She thought about shutting her eyes, pretending she was sleeping — but it was too late. Helly had <em> seen </em> her. Seen her watching her. Her gaze was frozen, wide. Her heart pounded in her throat. She was mortified. Burning. She didn’t move. She didn’t look away.</p><p>And Helly didn’t stop.</p><p>Her breath caught, then deepened. Her hand under the covers shifted — quicker now, more certain. Her eyes stayed fixed on Helena’s, waiting.</p><p>Helena’s pulse roared in her ears.</p><p>She couldn’t breathe. Couldn’t think. She didn’t look away. She <em> wanted </em> to look away. She thought she wanted to. Of <em> course </em>she wanted to. This was wrong. Sick. </p><p>And then Helly’s jaw clenched. Her body tensed, her eyes fluttered halfway shut — but only halfway. She was still looking at Helena when it happened.</p><p>The tension snapped. Her body arched just slightly, mouth open in a soundless exhale, shaking. Her fingers stilled beneath the covers. She stayed like that for a breath. Two. Then slowly relaxed, her hand falling away.</p><p>Helena hadn’t moved.</p><p>Helly blinked at her, illuminated by the dim glow of moonlight, flushed and wide-eyed, her chest rising and falling with each heavy breath. Her gaze was softer now. Still locked on Helena’s. Still waiting for something.</p><p>Helena didn’t know what. Her whole body felt hollowed out. Electric. A thousand thoughts screaming over each other in her mind. None of them coherent.</p><p>She didn’t know what to say. What to <em> do</em>. She just kept staring.</p><p>She must have failed whatever test Helly had been giving her, because after a moment, Helly sighed. Turned away. Pulled the blanket up over her shoulder like she was frustrated. Done.</p><p>And just like that, it was over.</p><p>She left Helena staring at the dark.</p><p>Left her burning.</p><p>⟡</p><p>Helly was older by a four-minute technicality, but Helena was older in the practical sense. More responsible. More careful. The one who always carried the extra sweater, the spare key, the first-aid kit in her backpack even when no one asked her to.</p><p>It was easy for everyone at the academy to believe Helena had always been that way — built for it. But the people who knew her now didn’t know what she used to be like. They didn’t know that she’d once been just as much of a troublemaker as Helly. That she used to be the one climbing the greenhouse scaffolding barefoot, slipping cherry pits into the estate’s irrigation vents just to see what would grow.</p><p>But Helly couldn’t stomach being scolded. Hated being the center of anyone’s disappointment. So Helena, feeling protective of her sister, started taking the blame for the both of them.</p><p>Once, when they were nine, Helly got caught drawing mustaches on the formal portraits in their father’s study. Helena had stood in front of her like a shield, marker in her own hand, and said she’d drawn all of them herself. Their father made her scrub every inch of canvas until her knuckles bled. Helly had cried harder than she did.</p><p>It kept happening. Small things, then bigger things. Over time, Helena got punished more. Flattened more. Smoothed out until only the obedient parts remained.</p><p>Her spirit dimmed. Helly’s roamed free. Of course Helly became Father’s favorite. It should’ve driven a wedge between them at the time. It didn’t. Helena loved her too much to let <em> him </em>be the reason they grew apart.</p><p>They’d slept in the same bed for years, even after their rooms were split. It had started as a protest, then a habit, then a comfort. Helena couldn’t fall asleep without the sound of Helly’s breathing behind her. </p><p>They used to joke that they shared a nervous system. If Helly scraped her knee, Helena limped for a day. If Helena got a stomachache, Helly wouldn’t eat. Helena always thought it was more than a joke. She still kind of did.</p><p>Now they barely spoke.</p><p>It made Helena sick to her stomach to think about it too much. So she didn’t. She kept busy — there was always enough to do. Enough protocol to memorize, enough doctrine to recite, enough order to restore. And she would be rewarded for it. For ignoring her own humanity. For pretending she didn’t ache.</p><p>Her reward was waiting for her at the end of the year: a seat she never asked for, a future she couldn’t escape. An inheritance she never wanted. A lifelong posting behind polished glass and measured smiles, dying in slow compliance.</p><p>Helly would take her trust fund and fuck off to New York for art school or whatever sounded most fun that week. Her future was open. Free. <em> Hers. </em>Helena didn’t know where she fit into it. If she did at all.</p><p>The wedge hadn’t come all at once. It wasn’t a rupture — not something they could point to and name. It was slower than that. More insidious. A corrosive force that crept in during the in-between moments, wearing them down grain by grain. Helena hadn’t noticed it slipping in until it was already there. It took root in the moments she’d chosen silence over solidarity, compliance over closeness. When she’d convinced herself that pleasing a father who never truly loved her mattered more than holding on to the one person who did. It hadn’t been intentional. But it had been enough.</p><p>Now, she missed her so much it made her chest ache. If she let herself think about it for more than a few seconds, it overwhelmed her. This sudden, suffocating need to be near Helly. To touch her. To hold her in ways that were intimate. Wrong. The kind of closeness she could only fantasize about in secret.</p><p>She turned the shower dial closer to red. The water was too hot. Steam curled around her face, her skin flushed raw. She stood under the spray with her forehead pressed to the tile, letting it pour over her like it could scrub her clean. It couldn’t. Her thighs still ached with heat. That same pulsing pressure low in her belly, insistent and sick. The image kept flashing behind her eyes — Helly’s parted lips, the rhythm of her breath, the exact moment their eyes met. Helena had spent the entire night trying to forget it. But it followed her. </p><p>She slammed the valve to the shower off. Got out, towelled herself dry. Thought about everything she had to do that day. Thought about anything and everything but this. She’d be gone in a month. Farther from Helly than she’d ever been. Maybe that was for the best.</p><p>She knew it wasn’t.</p><p>⟡</p><p>Once a month, if behavioral scores and attendance reports were deemed satisfactory across the cohort, the academy held a sanctioned “recreational night.” A single movie, pre-approved, projected in the common area of the dorms. The girls brought their own blankets. Popcorn was rationed out in wax paper cones. It was supposed to feel normal. It never quite did.</p><p>Still, the other girls liked it. It was a break in routine. A flicker of light in the dull gray rhythm.</p><p>Helena sat on the edge of her bed, already in her sleep clothes, brushing out her hair.</p><p>Helly’s voice echoed down the hallway. Helena’s stomach turned. She didn’t want to see her.</p><p>Natalie passed by the foot of her bed. “You’re not coming?”</p><p>Helena shook her head. “I’ve got a headache.”</p><p>Natalie just nodded, unfazed. Walked out the door. Helena could hear her voice in the distance a few seconds later. “No, she has a headache.” </p><p>Helena sighed. She recognized the sound of the stomping heading for her door.</p><p>“You can’t just take an advil?” Helly’s voice rounded the corner, meeting Helena’s gaze on her last syllables.</p><p>“I’m really tired.”</p><p>“This is the only time we ever get to spend together,” Helly frowned, head tilting in disbelief. “Weren’t you just accusing me of avoiding you?”</p><p>“I wasn’t <em> accusing </em>you. Don’t take everything so personally,” Helena rolled her eyes.</p><p>“Why are you being such a bitch right now?”</p><p>“I told you, I’m tired and I have a headache,” she lied. She didn’t want to get into it. She wanted Helly to go away so she could stop thinking. She wanted to scoop out her brain and factory reset it. Clean slate. That would be easier than dealing with whatever this was.</p><p>“Fine, I’ll stay here and take care of you. Even though you’re being a huge bitch,” she shut the door behind her.</p><p>“Don’t,” Helena put her brush on her desk, scooted back on her bed. “Just go enjoy the movie.”</p><p>“Uh, no,” Helly scoffed, jumping into Helena’s bed. “You think I give a shit about watching thinly veiled propaganda? I just miss my other half.” She draped her arm around her sister, resting her chin on her shoulder. “God, you’re freezing.”</p><p>She sighed. Helly always ran hot. She, on the other hand, felt like she teetered on the edge of hypothermia most days.</p><p>“They keep it way too cold in here. I swear they do it on purpose.”</p><p>“Just to torture us?” Helly grinned. “Yeah, that tracks.”</p><p>She could feel Helly smiling against her shoulder. The soft brush of her nose against her neck. When had her body started responding <em> this </em>intensely to Helly’s touch? She’d always loved being close to her. Always craved it. But it had been innocent. Innocent enough, at least.</p><p>Now her skin was prickling with awareness. Her breath too shallow. Her heart too fast.</p><p>Maybe it was the absence. The long months of distance, of silence, of watching Helly move further and further away. It had created a void, a hunger to fill it. Or maybe it was what she’d seen last night. Opening Pandora’s box.</p><p>Whatever it was, it felt wrong. She couldn’t enjoy it. Couldn’t let herself melt into Helly the way she wanted to. She just lay there. Rigid.</p><p>“You’re so <em> tense </em>,” Helly pulled back to examine her face. “Are you really this stressed about going back to Lumon next month?”</p><p>“No, it’s not—” Helena paused. “Well. I mean, yes. <em> Yes</em>. Of course I am. You know.” She exhaled, only then realizing she’d been holding her breath. “You’re the only one who knows what it’s really like there. With Father.”</p><p>“Yeah, fucking awful. A fate worse than death. Like getting stabbed. Repeatedly—”</p><p>“Yeah, something like that,” Helena laughed, cutting her off. She admired that about Helly — how freely she hated what they both hated. How she wasn’t afraid to say it out loud. How she embraced the truth rather than swallowed it. Helena didn’t know how to do that. She was sure she wouldn’t be able to.</p><p>Helly leaned her head against the wall, her eyes flicking toward the ceiling like she was searching for a better thought. “You know they’re screening <em> The Sea and the Cellar </em> tonight?” she said casually. “Again.”</p><p>“Didn’t know they were so obsessed with maritime metaphor,” Helena responded, a faint smirk tugging at her mouth.</p><p>“Or maybe it’s just the part where Kier flies off into the sunset. Hard to say.”</p><p>Helena huffed a quiet laugh. She knew what this was. Helly changing the subject. Steering the moment away from its edge. She was good at that. Good at making Helena feel human again.</p><p>Helly didn’t say anything else. She just shifted, lifting the blanket and tucking it around them both like it was the most natural thing in the world. It was, at one point. Helena stiffened for a moment, but the warmth under the covers was immediate — the kind that seeped into her bones. Her whole body ached with how much she needed it.</p><p>Helly’s arm brushed hers. Then settled. They lay like that for a while, Helly spooning her. Not speaking. Breathing in tandem.</p><p>Helena tried to focus on the movie still playing down the hall, muffled voices echoing faintly through the walls. Anything but the weight of Helly’s body next to hers. The heat radiating off her skin. The way her thigh was slowly—almost imperceptibly—edging between Helena’s legs.</p><p>It wasn’t intentional. It couldn’t be.</p><p>But it was there now, firm and warm and <em> too close</em>, pressing lightly against the place where Helena was already too aware of herself. She held her breath. </p><p>Helly didn’t move. Didn’t say anything.</p><p>And neither did Helena. She didn’t know if she could.</p><p>Helena stayed completely still. Her hands were folded across her stomach, elbows tucked in, as if containing herself could neutralize what was happening beneath the surface. As if stillness might make it untrue.</p><p>But the warmth of Helly’s thigh didn’t go away. If anything, it pressed closer. Not forcefully, but enough to make Helena’s breath catch again.</p><p>She thought about shifting. Rolling onto her side. Creating space. But doing that would <em> acknowledge </em> it. Would name it. </p><p>Helly exhaled — not a sigh, not a laugh, just the soft weight of air leaving her lungs. Her forehead grazed the back of Helena’s neck, barely a touch, but it made Helena’s skin light up.</p><p>She closed her eyes. Maybe if she kept them closed, she wouldn’t feel everything so vividly. She could pretend this wasn’t happening.</p><p>Helly’s hand slid across her waist — slow, gentle, anchoring. The touch was featherlight, but it made Helena’s entire body jolt, like she’d been shocked.</p><p>“Hey,” Helly whispered, voice barely audible.</p><p>Helena didn’t answer, terrified. She just kept breathing. Shallow. Uneven.</p><p>Helly’s hand didn’t move again. Neither did her thigh.</p><p>They just stayed like that — two bodies sharing one too-small bed, one blanket, one history, one unbearable silence. Somewhere inside Helena, something cracked. Something that had been held tight for years.</p><p>She dragged herself slowly, cautiously against the solid warmth of Helly’s thigh. So slight she could have denied it even to herself.</p><p>She did it again. Again.</p><p>The pressure lit something low and deep inside her — a sharp, pulsing ache that bloomed into unbearable heat. Her chest clenched with it. Her throat tightened. Her face burned. She bit her lip.</p><p>She thought maybe Helly hadn’t noticed.</p><p>She was wrong.</p><p>Helly’s hand, still resting against Helena’s waist, grabbed her hip. Quietly anchoring her. Like she’d been waiting for this.</p><p>Helena’s cheeks flushed so hot she felt dizzy. Shame curled in her gut like smoke. But her body was moving now without her permission, unmistakably rocking her core against her sister’s thigh. Each shift of her hips sent a ripple of friction through her. Subtle. Sharp. Addictive.</p><p>Helly said nothing. Did nothing. She didn’t need to. The way she was holding her was permission enough.</p><p>Helena closed her eyes, the ache building fast now. Her breaths came shallower. Faster. She pressed her thighs tighter around Helly’s, chasing the next wave, the next tiny relief. She didn’t know what this was. She just knew she couldn’t stop.</p><p>And Helly — warm, silent, steady behind her — <em> let her</em>.</p><p>The tension was unbearable. Her thighs trembled with it, her breath catching in small, humiliating gasps. She tried to be quiet. Tried to make it look like nothing was happening. But her body gave her away — every tiny stutter of her hips, the desperate curl of her fingers in the blanket.</p><p>She was close.</p><p>The ache between her legs pulsed hot and sharp, a rhythm she couldn’t quiet. It was too much. She bit down on her lip hard enough to hurt, stifling the moan that wanted to escape. Then — with one last helpless grind of her hips, one final wave of unbearable tension — she came.</p><p>Silently. Violently. Shamefully.</p><p>Her whole body tensed, bowed, then shuddered as the feeling swept through her. Her stomach clenched. Her thighs seized. Her hands clenched the blanket in fists. She felt the wetness flood her underwear — warm, slick, impossible to hide. Her chest rose and fell in shallow bursts. Her face was burning. Her limbs felt hollow. Her skin too tight. She wanted to disappear. Melt into the mattress. Slip through the floor and vanish entirely.</p><p>Helly didn’t let go. Her hand was still there. Soft. Solid. Kind.</p><p>“Helena?”</p><p>She didn’t answer.</p><p>Helly’s hand flexed gently at her waist. “Are you okay?”</p><p>Helena forced herself to nod. It wasn’t entirely a lie. She <em> was </em> okay — in the sense that she was still breathing. Still alive. But she wasn’t okay, not really. And Helly knew that.</p><p>“That was…” Helly’s voice trailed off. “You can tell me to shut up if you want.”</p><p>Helena let out a breath that might’ve been a laugh. “I won’t.”</p><p>A pause. “Did you want that to happen?”</p><p>Helena’s mouth opened. Closed. She didn’t know what to say. Yes. No. <em> God</em>, yes.</p><p>“I didn’t mean for it to happen,” she whispered.</p><p>Helly’s voice was even softer now. “But you didn’t stop.”</p><p>Helena’s eyes finally opened. She stared into the dark, blank wall in front of her, as if it might offer absolution. “You let me keep going.”</p><p>“I didn’t want you to stop,” Helly admitted.</p><p>Helena blinked. Swallowed. Her voice was barely audible. “This is wrong.”</p><p>“I know,” Helly said. “I don’t care.”</p>

  <p>Helena woke to the sound of footsteps. Dozens of them. Shuffling, squeaking slippers on tile. Low voices. Laughter. The movie had ended.</p><p>Her eyes snapped open.</p><p>Helly was still behind her. One arm curled around her middle. Their bodies pressed together under the blanket.</p><p>
  <em> Still in the same bed. </em>
</p><p>She tensed, breath caught in her throat. She could hear the girls filing past the door. Natalie could walk in at any second. One glance — that’s all it would take. Beds were not to be shared. Under <em> any </em> circumstance. </p><p>Helly stirred behind her. “Shit,” she whispered, suddenly awake. Her voice was hoarse. “What time is it?”</p><p>“I don’t know.” Helena’s voice barely made it out. Her throat was dry. </p><p>Helly slipped her arm back slowly, carefully, like any sudden movement might draw attention through the walls. Helena threw the blanket off with a shaky hand and swung her legs over the edge of the bed. Her heart was pounding so loud she swore it would give them away.</p><p>The hallway was alive now — doors clicking open, voices rising, laughter echoing against the cement walls. Helena stood, tugging down the hem of her sleep shirt, willing her legs to stop shaking.</p><p>Helly stayed in the bed a second longer, as if reluctant to let the warmth between them vanish entirely.</p><p>“Get up,” Helena commanded, eyes flicking to the door. “Now.”</p><p>Helly sat up, wiped her face with both hands like she could erase sleep, guilt, anything else clinging to her. Then she slipped out from under the blanket and moved to her own bed — quiet as a shadow.</p><p>Just as she pulled the covers over herself, the door creaked open. Natalie.</p><p>She stepped inside mid-sentence, still laughing at something someone had said out in the hall. “Honestly, if I hear one more metaphor about drowning—”</p><p>She paused.</p><p>Looked at Helena, curled under her own blanket. At Helly, blinking sleepily.</p><p>“Sorry,” Natalie whispered, closing the door behind her.</p><p>Helena’s body didn’t relax. She stared at Helly from across the room, already missing her warmth.</p><p>⟡</p><p>Helena moved through her routine. Her uniform was pressed. Her bangs parted sharply to the side. Her posture, as always, was perfect. But her mind was somewhere else entirely. </p><p>Every lecture sounded like static, every word from her instructors passed through her like light through glass. She nodded when she was supposed to. Took the appropriate amount of notes. Answered questions correctly when called on.</p><p>But nothing could distract her from the ache in her chest. Every time she blinked, she saw Helly’s face in the dark. Felt the way their bodies fit together beneath the blanket. The softness. The stillness. The <em> heat. </em></p><p>She kept her expression neutral as she walked from class to class, but her thoughts wouldn’t settle. They kept slipping back — to the warmth of Helly’s breath on her neck. The pressure of her thigh. The way she didn’t move, didn’t speak, didn’t <em> judge. </em></p><p>Under all of that, memory after memory — buried like roots. The way Helly used to braid her hair for her in the mornings, even when they were late. The way she used to sleep with one hand curled into Helena’s shirt, afraid she’d disappear. The way they used to hold hands at assemblies before they were told not to.</p><p>There had been boys, of course. Brief things. Pointless things. A hand on her back at the garden party. A kiss during summer break. A boy who wrote her a poem once — terrible, sweet.</p><p>But none of them made her <em> feel </em> the way Helly did. None of them made her want.</p><p>She caught glimpses of Helly in the halls between classes — always laughing with someone, always in motion. She wanted to be near her again. Close enough to touch. Close enough to breathe her in. She wanted it so badly it made her stomach hurt.</p><p>Helena opened her locker just before lunch and found a note tucked inside. Folded twice. No name. Just her handwriting — unmistakable. Messy, impatient. She looked over her shoulder before unfolding it.</p><p>
  <em> im skipping class during ur lunch. meet me in the auditorium? </em>
</p><p>No signature. None needed. Her throat tightened.</p><p>She read it again. Then again.</p><p>The hallway was noisy — girls laughing, lockers slamming shut, shoes squeaking on the waxed floor — but it all sounded muffled now, like she was underwater. She tucked the note into her bag and closed her locker with a quiet click.</p><p>She didn’t go to the dining hall. She turned the other way.</p><p>The auditorium was at the far end of the north wing, past the music rooms and the chapel. No one was there usually. It was reserved for assemblies, drills, and presentations — always locked unless scheduled. But it wasn’t locked now. Of course Helly had gotten her hands on the key.</p><p>The door creaked open under her hand. The lights were off, but sunlight filtered through the high windows, casting long, solemn rectangles across the floor. It was vast, silent. Rows and rows of empty seats. And there, halfway down the aisle — Helly.</p><p>Auburn hair, half-illuminated bright red by a pillar of sunlight. Pale leg draped over the other, arms crossed. Sitting casually. Like she wasn’t going to get in trouble for skipping class. Like she wasn’t waiting for Helena with a pit in her stomach. Like they weren’t about to make another terrible mistake.</p><p>Helena stepped inside and closed the door behind her. Locked it. The echo clicked through the auditorium like a confession.</p><p>They just looked at each other — a long, slow, loaded silence stretching across rows of empty chairs and every hour they’d spent apart.</p><p>Then Helly raised her chin, just slightly. A wordless signal. <em> Come here. </em></p><p>Helena’s feet moved before her brain could catch up. Down the aisle, past the light slicing through the high windows, past shadows that stretched like fingers across the floor. She stopped at the row.</p><p>Helly didn’t smile. Didn’t speak. Just uncrossed her arms, let them fall to her sides, fingers twitching against her thighs like she didn’t know what to do with them.</p><p>Helena sat beside her.</p><p>The silence roared.</p><p>Helena could feel her heartbeat in her throat, behind her eyes, low in her belly. The ghost of the night before still lingered in her muscles — in the ache between her legs, in the warmth she kept chasing in her mind.</p><p>“I’m really sorry about last night,” Helly said quietly. “I think,” she paused, nervous. Helena could count on one hand the amount of times she had seen Helly get nervous. “I think I just miss you, and—”</p><p>Helena couldn’t bear it. She leaned in and kissed her. Helly inhaled sharply against her mouth — surprised, but not pulling away.</p><p>Her lips parted just enough for Helena to deepen it. There was no finesse, no practiced rhythm, just heat. Hunger. The thrum of weeks, months, years of closeness and absence unraveling into something they couldn't take back.</p><p>Helly’s hands found her waist — tentative at first, then firmer, dragging her in, gripping the fabric of her uniform like she wanted to anchor herself to Helena’s body.</p><p>The kiss broke once. Barely. Just enough for breath.</p><p>Then again — harder this time. Messier. Helly tilted her head, pulled Helena closer, her hands now slipping beneath the hem of her shirt where skin waited, flushed and eager. Helena gasped, her fingers tangling in Helly’s hair, tugging just enough to make her whimper.</p><p>The seats around them creaked as they shifted, bodies angling, knees bumping. The room was vast but felt impossibly small. Like it had folded itself around them. Like the air had thickened with want.</p><p>Helena didn't know where this was going. She just knew she didn’t want it to stop. Knew she couldn’t stop it. She was the titanic and Helly was the iceberg. All she could do was sink.</p><p>Helena was already breathless, but it wasn’t enough. She needed more. She climbed into Helly’s lap, straddling her thighs, knees bracketing her hips, skirts bunching between them. The movement was clumsy, desperate. She didn’t care.</p><p>Helly let out a quiet, helpless sound — half gasp, half moan — and grabbed at her again. Hands under her shirt now, palming the soft skin of her lower back.</p><p>They kissed harder. Sloppier. Their teeth clanked and they giggled. Helly gripped her tighter in response, pulling her down against her like she wanted to fuse them together. She slipped her hand up under her skirt, into her panties. Quickly found the spot she was looking for. Added friction, pressure. Helena gasped, grinding against her hand.</p><p>Helena whispered, voice barely there, “I can’t—”</p><p>“Don’t stop,” Helly breathed. “Don’t you <em> fucking </em> stop.”</p><p>Helena ground down again, harder this time, their bodies catching in the rhythm — skirts rucked up, tights twisted, heat building fast and bright and unbearable. Every nerve in her body was tuned to Helly’s hand, Helly’s mouth, the press of her beneath her, between her legs.</p><p>She felt wild. Unmade. Like everything she’d held down for years was now clawing its way out of her in waves. She felt the first spasm curl low in her belly and her whole body locked tight. She moaned into Helly’s mouth — sharp, shaking, ruined — as she came. Hard.</p><p>Right there, on Helly’s hand, in the dark auditorium, with her skirt hiked up and her shame peeled back to the bone.</p><p>She trembled, buried her face in Helly’s neck, panting against her skin.</p><p>Helly held her like she was something precious. Or breakable. Both.</p><p>They stayed like that for a moment. Breathing into each other. Helena trembling, clinging. Helly holding, steady. But not calm. She was shaking with need.</p><p>Helena could feel it — the way Helly’s chest rose and fell irregularly. The restless twitch of her fingers against her back. The tension gathered under her skin like a coil pulled tight.</p><p>Helena pulled back, just enough to see her face.</p><p>Helly’s eyes were glassy. Pupils blown. Lips swollen. Cheeks flushed a shade Helena had never seen on her before.</p><p>“Don’t make me beg,” Helly whispered, voice low.</p><p>Helena tilted her head. “Beg?”</p><p>“Touch me.” Helly’s voice cracked. Too needy. Too desperate for teasing. “Touch me the way I touched you. Please.” She looked up at her like she’d die if Helena didn’t say yes.</p><p>Helena leaned in and kissed her — softer this time. Slower. Letting it spread between them like a flame across paper. Then her hand slipped down, beneath the hem of Helly’s skirt, fingers sliding along the edge of her tights.</p><p>Helly let out a sound like she was trying not to cry.</p><p>“Please,” she whispered again. “Please.”</p><p>Helena didn’t make her wait. She pressed inside, slow at first, careful, until she felt Helly’s thighs shake around her. Until she felt how soaked she already was — slick and hot and barely holding it together.</p><p>Helly buried her face in Helena’s shoulder, one hand fisting her shirt, the other gripping the armrest. Every movement of Helena’s fingers pulled another helpless sound from her. Soft, shattered, nothing like the girl the rest of the world knew.</p><p>“You’re soaked,” Helena breathed against her ear.</p><p>Helly nodded, eyes shut tight, lips parted. “I’ve been like this since last night,” she whispered. “Since you—<em> fuck </em>, since you—”</p><p>Helena curled her fingers just right, and Helly broke.</p><p>She gasped — full-body, quaking — and came against her hand, hard, with a whimper so raw Helena swore it went straight to the center of her. She held her through it. Watched her fall apart.</p><p>Helly’s body arched, then collapsed, melting into her like she’d finally exhaled after holding her breath for years.</p><p>They stayed like that. Quiet. Wrapped around each other. Their bodies tangled. Their hearts racing.</p><p>Helena shifted slightly, exhaling. “So,” she murmured, voice hoarse, “what is this, then?”</p><p>Helly blinked up at her, still breathless. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“I mean…” Helena hesitated. “Are we going to keep doing this? Sneaking around? Getting off on each other?”</p><p>Helly stared at her for a beat. “Can you please take your fingers out of me before we have this conversation?”</p><p>Helena blinked. Then laughed — <em> really </em> laughed — surprised and raw and maybe a little embarrassed.</p><p>“Right,” she said, clearing her throat as she slowly, carefully withdrew her hand.</p><p>Helly shivered and cursed under her breath. “<em>Jesus</em>.”</p><p>Helena wiped her fingers on her own skirt without thinking, then grimaced. </p><p>Helly laughed. “Next time, don't wear your good uniform.”</p><p>Helena adjusted her skirt, self-conscious now, suddenly aware of how exposed they were. How fast it had all happened. How sickeningly easy it had been to give in.</p><p>Helly leaned back in her seat. Her chest was still rising and falling a little too fast.</p><p>“Okay, so,” Helena said again, quieter this time. “What is this?”</p><p>Helly tilted her head up. “I think about you all the time. I try not to, but I can’t help it.”</p><p>Helena stared at her.</p><p>“I know we shouldn’t be doing this,” Helly continued. “But when you’re near me, I feel like I can breathe again. And when you’re not, it’s like I’m missing my skin.”</p><p>Helena’s stomach turned with recognition. How long had they been circling this? Pretending it wasn’t real?</p><p>“I thought I was the only one who felt that way,” she whispered.</p><p>“You’re not.” Helly’s eyes were steady now. “I didn’t know you did either.”</p><p>“This is so fucked up,” Helena shook her head. “You realize that, right? If anyone ever found out— if <em> Father </em>ever found out— “</p><p>“He won’t,” Helly ran her hands up Helena’s sides. She felt so small in her lap. “Nobody has to know.”</p><p>“And if we get caught?”</p><p>“We just won’t get caught.”</p><p>Helena scoffed. “This place is a panopticon. It’s only a matter of time.” She shook her head, her senses coming back to her. “No, Helly. We can’t do this.”</p><p>“Okay, but,” Helly craned her head up, closer, trying to close some distance. “If not now, then when? We graduate next month, and then we’ll see each other what— two? Three times a year, if we’re lucky?”</p><p>“You could come to Lumon with me,” Helena reasoned. She had a bargaining chip now. A way to get Helly back into the family. A way to make being back there bearable.</p><p>Helly scoffed, nearly pushing her off. “You can’t do this to me, Helena. I can’t go back there. I just can’t. I’d kill myself. Seriously.”</p><p>“You’re being dramatic.”</p><p>“You’re not being dramatic <em> enough</em>,” Helly insisted. “You could come with me instead.”</p><p>“I absolutely cannot.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Father doesn’t love me like he loves you,” Helena shook her head, like it was the most obvious statement in the world. “He would cut me off.”</p><p>“We can live off my trust fund,” Helly reasoned. “There’s more than enough for both of us.”</p><p>Helena climbed off her lap. This was usually where she ended the conversation. Where she chose silence over truth. Swallowed it for the both of them.</p><p>But Helly was looking up at her so desperately. Like she couldn’t understand why her other half didn’t love her enough to leave the place that was the source of their misery. Why they couldn’t just be happy together.</p><p>She was frustrated that Helly couldn’t put the puzzle pieces together herself.</p><p>“Listen,” Helena pinched the bridge of her nose. “Do you really think Father is going to just accept that Lumon has no heir? That an Eagan won’t take over?”</p><p>“That’s his problem,” Helly shook her head.</p><p>“It’s <em> our </em>problem, Helly. Father is not a kind man. He’s spiteful. He would—.”</p><p>“He won’t—”</p><p>“I’m eating this for us both, okay? So just let me eat it.”</p><p>Helly looked angry. She stood up, facing her, inches from her face in the claustrophobic aisle. “You’re not a sacrificial lamb. You’re a <em> person</em>. You deserve to have a life.”</p><p>There it was again — that look in Helly’s eyes. Like she couldn’t understand. Like this was a matter of <em> choice. </em></p><p>“I don’t get to have a life,” Helena said, quietly.</p><p>“You <em> do</em>,” Helly insisted. “You just don’t believe you deserve one.”</p><p>Helena’s jaw clenched.</p><p>“I watched you bleed for him, Helena. For years. You think I didn’t see it? You think I don’t know what he did to you — what he still does to you?”</p><p>“Stop.”</p><p>“<em>No</em>. You don’t get to martyr yourself for me and call it love.”</p><p>Helena’s eyes burned.</p><p>Helly softened.</p><p>“I don’t want you to choose me,” she said. “I want you to choose <em> yourself. </em> And if I get to be part of that? Great. But I’m not gonna be the reason you survive in misery. I want to be the reason you choose to live.”</p><p>Helena looked away. Her throat locked up. There was too much in her chest. Nowhere to put it. She took a deep breath to compose herself.</p><p>“I really fucking miss you,” Helena paused, trying to think of something, anything. A counter-argument. An excuse to keep protecting her. A reason to continue down this path. She found nothing. Her eyes filled with tears. “I just really fucking miss you.”</p><p>Helly closed the distance between them and wrapped her in a hug. Held her tighter than she had ever been held before. Helena let herself fold into it. Helly’s arms wrapped around her like a second spine, steady and warm, like she could hold the broken parts together if she just pressed hard enough. Helena buried her face in her shoulder and breathed her in.</p><p>“You’re here with me now,” Helly whispered.</p><p>“I don’t know if I can do this,” Helena said. It wasn’t an excuse. Just the truth.</p><p>“I know,” Helly said. “But maybe you can think about it?”</p><p>They stood like that for a long time — in the quiet hush of the auditorium, where their secrets clung to the rafters and guilt lingered on their breath. The clock was still ticking. Time hadn’t stopped for them. Eventually they’d have to go. Face the routines. The eyes. The future.</p><p>But for now? Helly just held her.</p><p>And Helena let her.</p>

  <p>Helena didn’t speak to Helly for three days. Not in any meaningful sense.</p><p>She saw her across the dining hall, laughing at something Natalie said. Saw her disappear around the corner outside her morning lecture. Saw the back of her head two rows down in Ethics, where Helena could trace the fall of her curls by memory. But they didn’t have any time to themselves.</p><p>Not because something had gone wrong. Not because either of them had decided to stop. It was simply the nature of this place to keep them apart. Their schedules were always just out of sync, a quiet but relentless undertow pulling them in opposite directions. Helena left stranded on the shore, watching, while Helly drifted further out to sea. </p><p>The distance between them wasn’t loud or dramatic. But it <em>was</em> unbearable.</p><p>Helena tried to keep busy — anything to quiet her mind. She organized her notes until her hands chafed against the paper. Rearranged her side of the closet by color, then by season. Deep cleaned every inch of her room. She counted her steps between classes. Counted the hours since the auditorium. Counted the number of times Helly appeared uninvited in her thoughts.</p><p>Every hour, a reminder. Every ache between her legs, a cruel echo.</p><p>She hated it. She wanted it again. She hated that most of all.</p><p>⟡</p><p>Natalie packed her bag without fanfare. Her train home was almost here.</p><p>“I’ll be back Sunday night,” she said, zipping her case with clinical precision. “Don’t touch my stuff.”</p><p>Helena nodded, the gesture automatic. She barely registered Natalie’s words. Couldn’t believe what she was hearing. In all their years of sharing a dorm, Natalie had never gone home outside of official breaks. Never left her alone with her sister. Not once.</p><p>Now, suddenly, she was leaving. A family emergency. A gift from Kier or God or the universe or whatever could explain Helena getting something she actually wanted, for once.</p><p>Helly was sitting on the edge of her bed, reading something she wasn’t really reading. Her leg crossed over her knee. A pencil between her teeth. A convincing performance of nonchalance  — if you didn’t know her.</p><p>When the door clicked shut behind Natalie, it didn’t feel like a roommate leaving. It felt like a fuse being lit.</p><p>Helena didn’t move. Helly looked up, tapping her pencil against her kneecap. </p><p>The silence thickened.</p><p>Stretched.</p><p>Thinned.</p><p>Snapped.</p><p>“I’m gonna lose my mind if you don’t say something,” Helly said finally.</p><p>Helena opened her mouth. Closed it again. Then let out a stunned little laugh. “Have we even had more than an hour alone together in the last four years?”</p><p>Helly threw her pencil behind her headboard. “We <em> have </em>to fuck, right?” She tilted her head, eyes wide, wild. Like she was seconds from detonation. “There’s no way we don’t fuck right now, right?”</p><p>“<em>Jesus</em>, Helly.” The words landed heavy, crude in their ease. Helena’s skin prickled. A flush bloomed across her cheeks and chest.</p><p>Helly raised her eyebrows, smirked a little, entirely unrepentant. “What?”</p><p>“You can’t just— say things like <em> that</em>.” Helena was sure she was trying to provoke her. She hated how transparent her discomfort must’ve been. Hated, more, that Helly saw it, and said it anyway.</p><p>“Why not?” Helly stood, gaze locked on hers. A challenge. She always did this — peeled things open just to see what was underneath.</p><p>“Because I—” Helena gestured vaguely, helplessly. “It makes what we’re doing sound worse.”</p><p>“Worse than what? Worse than what we did in the auditorium?” Helly stepped closer, voice low. “Or would you rather dress it up? Call it something easier to swallow?”</p><p>“I’m just trying to think clearly.” Helena took a step back. Her hip bumped the desk. She gripped the edge, white-knuckled, hoping it would ground her.</p><p>“Don’t,” Helly said, closing the space between them like it was nothing. “It’s not working.”</p><p>A long pause. Their eyes stayed locked. Helena’s pulse thudded in her throat, loud enough — she was sure — for Helly to hear it.</p><p>“You really think we’re going to spend the whole weekend in here and <em> not </em> touch each other?” Helly’s voice had softened now, inches from her face. “Come on. You can’t even look at me without going quiet.”</p><p>Helena didn’t speak. Didn’t move. Just stared at her, restless with something unspoken — desire, dread, surrender — for one long, electric second. Then she nodded. Once. Small. Almost nothing.</p><p>And Helly stepped forward and kissed her like she was making up for lost time.</p><p>Helena didn’t even have time to gasp before she was pressed hard against the desk’s edge. Helly followed, mouth hot and searching. The silence of the past week had been a sickness, and the cure lay behind mirrored lips.</p><p>Her hands slid beneath Helena’s thighs, lifting her in one fluid motion. A soft, startled sound escaped as Helena was set on the desk, knees parting instinctively to let Helly move in.</p><p>The kiss deepened, greedy and desperate. Like they’d been holding their breath. Like they finally had permission to exhale.</p><p>“You have no idea what this week did to me,” Helly whispered into her mouth. “I’m not holding back.”</p><p>“You didn’t hold back last time,” Helena managed to breathe, tugging her closer.</p><p>Helly smiled against her lips. “Just wait.”</p><p>She kissed her again — rougher now, tongue dragging, hands gripping Helena’s hips like she was claiming something already hers.</p><p>Helena moaned into it. She couldn’t help it. The tension in her body snapped into want. Need.</p><p>They had time, and they were going to use every second.</p><p>Helly’s hands slid down her thighs, firm and assured, until they found the hem of her skirt. In one motion, she pushed it up, gathered it, bunched the fabric at Helena’s hips. Her fingers moved fast, fevered — hooking into the waistband of her underwear and tugging down.</p><p>Helena gasped at the exposure, at the speed, at the sheer audacity of it.</p><p>“What are you— ” she started, breathless.</p><p>And then Helly dropped to her knees.</p><p>Helena’s legs trembled, dangling off the desk. Her grip on the edge tightened, like she needed something to keep her from floating out of her own skin.</p><p>She felt Helly’s breath first — warm, deliberate — ghosting over her before anything else. And then Helly’s tongue was on her. Slow. Certain. Like she meant it. Like she already knew what Helena liked. Like she’d done it before.</p><p>Helena’s head tipped back, a sharp breath catching in her throat. “<em>Fuck, Helly</em>.”</p><p>Her name kept slipping out of her lips in whispers and gasps, back arched, mouth parted, hips rolling helplessly against her mouth. Her fingers slid into Helly’s hair, not guiding — just holding<em>. </em> Clinging. Something to tether her.</p><p>Her thighs quivered. Her breaths came in shallow, uneven gasps. Her head tipped back, then forward again, like she couldn’t decide whether to flee the feeling or fall into it completely.</p><p>She was close already. It scared her how fast it happened — how quickly she lost herself to Helly’s mouth.</p><p>“You taste so good,” Helly whispered against her.</p><p>“Please,” she gasped. She wasn’t even sure what she was asking for.</p><p>And then it hit her — hot, sharp, overwhelming. It started low, deep in her belly, and spread like fire. Bright and sudden, stealing every thought as it went. Her whole body tensed, legs tightening around Helly’s shoulders, breath catching on a gasp that barely made it past her lips.</p><p>She came with a soft, choked cry, head thrown back, spine arched off the desk. It ripped through her, wave after wave, too much, the kind of release that felt like it might break her open. Her hands clutched blindly, back and forth between Helly’s hair, the desk, nothing at all. She couldn’t hold on.</p><p>The pleasure kept cresting, sharp and insistent. A full-body unraveling that knocked the air from her lungs and left her shuddering in its wake.</p><p>She didn’t realize her hand ended up buried deep in Helly’s hair until her sister pulled back gently, pressing a kiss to the inside of her thigh.</p><p>Helena blinked at the ceiling. Her heart was racing. Her skin was damp. Her hands were shaking.</p><p>She felt wrecked. Wanted.</p><p>And then Helly stood. Pressed her forehead to Helena’s. Just breathed. She leaned in to kiss her gently. She tasted herself on Helly’s lips, and something inside her pulled taut.</p><p>“Wow,” Helena breathed, a shaky laugh catching in her throat. “You’re— good at that.”</p><p>Helly looked amused. “I can tell.”</p><p>Helena slid off the desk with wobbly legs. Helly steadied her with both hands on her waist, then gave her a soft little nudge toward the bed. They climbed in together, still half-dressed. Helena pulled the blanket over them out of instinct. Habit. Like it would make any of this feel safer.</p><p>They lay there for a moment, quiet. Helly ran her fingers up and down Helena’s forearm.</p><p>“You don’t have to do that, you know,” Helly said suddenly.</p><p>Helena blinked. “Do what?”</p><p>“Return the favor. Just because I…” She trailed off, gesturing loosely toward the desk. “Did all that.”</p><p>Helena tilted her head. “Why wouldn’t I?”</p><p>Helly shrugged. “I just know you’ve… liked boys. So it’s probably different. For you.”</p><p>“I guess,” Helena said slowly. Then, “But it’s not like I wouldn’t be able to figure it out.”</p><p>Helly smiled — crooked, almost shy. “I meant more that I <em> like </em> doing that. I like girls.”</p><p>It landed so gently it barely made a ripple.</p><p>“Oh,” Helena said, blinking. “Okay.”</p><p>It wasn’t exactly a surprise. But hearing it out loud felt like opening a door she hadn’t realized was shut.</p><p>“I like <em> you</em>,” Helena added, quieter now. “I think that’s the only part that matters.”</p><p>Helly looked at her for a long time. Then nodded. “Yeah. That’s the part that matters.” </p><p>She paused, enjoying the closeness. Enjoying that Helly was hers and hers alone, if only for this weekend. But she couldn’t shake what she just heard. “So, you’ve done that before?”</p><p>“Gone down on a girl?”</p><p>Helena gave a tiny shrug, immediately regretting asking. “You said you liked doing it.”</p><p>“I do,” Helly said simply. “And yeah. I’ve done it before.”</p><p>Helena nodded like that didn’t mean anything, like her stomach didn’t just tighten. “Okay.”</p><p>“Hey,” Helly said, reading her like a book. “I didn’t mean to make it weird.”</p><p>“It’s not weird,” Helena lied.</p><p>“You’re doing that face.”</p><p>“What face?”</p><p>“The <em> processing something you’re pretending not to be feeling </em> face.”</p><p>Helena groaned and covered her eyes with her forearm. “God, shut up.”</p><p>Helly laughed, warm and easy, and leaned in to press a kiss to the corner of her mouth. “You’re better than all of them.”</p><p>“Gee, thanks,” Helena rolled her eyes.</p><p>“What about you?” Helly asked, voice quiet now. Less teasing. “Have you… ever been with someone before?”</p><p>Helena hesitated. “Not really.”</p><p>Helly raised an eyebrow. “Not really?”</p><p>Helena sighed. “I tried going down on a guy once.”</p><p>“Tried?”</p><p>“It was just— bad.” She covered her face again, groaning softly. “Can we not talk about this?”</p><p>Helly grinned, wicked. “Oh, now <em> I </em> want to talk about it.”</p><p>“No you don’t.”</p><p>“I absolutely do.”</p><p>Helena peeked at her from beneath her arm. “He didn’t, like… guide me. Or say anything. Just sort of sat there like he was doing me a favor by existing while I got him off.”</p><p>Helly blinked. “Gross.”</p><p>“Right?” Helena dropped her arm. “I thought I was broken or something. Like I was supposed to love doing it, and I just… didn’t.”</p><p>Helly nodded slowly. “You’re not broken.”</p><p>“I didn’t feel anything. Just this pressure to be good at it. And I wasn’t.” Helena gave a small, humorless laugh. “I stopped after like, two minutes and never saw him again.” Her nose wrinkled at the memory — disgusted, but mostly at herself.</p><p>“Well,” Helly said, sliding her hand up Helena’s thigh again, slow and deliberate, “if you want to try again,” she whispered, leaning closer, “you’ve got a much better test subject this time.”</p><p>Helena’s heart was pounding. She couldn’t remember the last time she wanted something this much — not because it was expected of her, not because she wanted approval. Just because it was real. And because Helly was looking at her like <em> that</em>. Hungry. Desperate.</p><p>“Okay,” Helena said softly. Her voice was quiet but clear. “I want to.”</p><p>Helly stilled — not in hesitation, but in surprise. Like she hadn’t expected Helena to say yes so soon. Her breath hitched. “You do?”</p><p>Helena nodded. “I want to know what it feels like when I actually want it.”</p><p>Helly kissed her once — soft and slow — then lay back against the pillows, her fingers toying gently with the edge of Helena’s shirt.</p><p>“You can stop any time,” Helly assured her.</p><p>Helena didn’t respond. She just moved — slowly, like every motion required its own small act of courage. Her skin was flushed, her breath uneven. Everything felt too loud inside her. Her hands shook slightly as she slid down the bed, knees catching against the blanket. </p><p>She paused between Helly’s legs, hovering. Blinking up at her.</p><p>Helly nodded. Gave the smallest smile. She looked so much more vulnerable than she usually did. “Take your time.”</p><p>She did. She kissed up Helly’s inner thigh first — tentative, then firmer, gauging every breath, every shift. She pulled her skirt down, catching her underwear with it, and tossed them off the bed. She could feel the tension in Helly’s legs, the way she was holding herself open, the way she was already shaking.</p><p>Then Helena leaned in.</p><p>Her mouth was unsure at first — careful, exploratory — but Helly’s body answered every touch like a compass. A sharp inhale. A soft gasp. A hand tightening in the sheets. That was enough. She followed instinct. Adjusted, tried again, emboldened by every small reaction.</p><p>She moved slowly, hands gripping Helly’s thighs, breath coming hot and uneven. She needed to get this right — needed Helly to feel what she’d felt. The ache of it. The surrender. Not to even the score, but to sink into her. To press closer in the only way she could. To give something back that felt just as consuming.</p><p>She was getting lost in it. The taste, the scent, the way Helly moved beneath her. It was dizzying. Addictive. She hadn’t expected her own body to respond like this. This was supposed to be a gesture. A way to show Helly she was willing to serve, to give. But she was enjoying it — too much, maybe. Greedy for it.</p><p>Taking as much as she gave, and wanting more.</p><p>Helly was already coming apart.</p><p>Her thighs tensed. Her hips rolled. Her voice caught in her throat — and then didn’t. A shaky, breathy moan spilled out, helpless and quiet.</p><p>“<em>Fuck </em>, Helena…”</p><p>She kept going — growing bolder, more confident with every stuttered breath Helly gave her. She felt hands slide into her hair, desperately pulling.</p><p>Helena could feel the shift — the stuttering of Helly’s hips, the way her name spilled from her lips like a secret burning its way out.</p><p>“Don’t stop,” Helly gasped. “Don’t— fuck, <em> please</em>—”</p><p>She didn’t. She pressed in, held her steady, and let it happen.</p><p>Helly came with a shudder that rippled through her whole body. Not sharp — <em> deep</em>. A long, broken moan, her hand still buried in Helena’s hair, clinging to her like she was the only thing keeping her tethered to the world. Then her body gave out, slumping back against the bed, spent and breathless.</p><p>Helena rested her cheek against Helly’s thigh, just for a moment. Just to breathe in the aftermath. Stay close to her scent. She tried not to think about how crazy it made her. What that meant.</p><p>Then she climbed up, slow and quiet, until she was curled into Helly’s side again. Helly’s arm wrapped around her without a word. They lay there flushed and wrecked and clinging to something neither of them could name yet.</p><p>Helena felt Helly press a kiss to her forehead.</p><p>“You’re <em> so </em> good at that,” she mumbled.</p><p>Helena laughed softly. “Beginner’s luck.”</p><p>“Shut up,” Helly smiled against her skin. </p><p>Helly’s hand drew lazy shapes on Helena’s shoulder. Circles. Lines. Nonsense patterns that made Helena feel like she might melt through the mattress. But her mind wouldn’t still.</p><p>“Can I ask you something?” Helena whispered.</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>Helena hesitated. She hated the sound of her own voice when it wavered like this. “What are we doing?”</p><p>Helly’s fingers stilled.</p><p>“I mean,” Helena added quickly, “is this just because we’re here? Like— if we were somewhere else, if we weren’t at the academy, if we weren’t so—”</p><p>“Repressed?” Helly offered, dry.</p><p>Helena let out a breath. “Yeah.”</p><p>Helly turned onto her side, propping herself up slightly to look at her.</p><p>“Are you asking if this is a phase?”</p><p>Helena looked away. “I don’t know what I’m asking.”</p><p>Helly was quiet for a moment. “Do you want it to be?”</p><p>Helena didn’t answer right away. Her throat tightened. She didn’t know how to say that the idea of it <em> not </em> being a phase scared her. That if it was real, it could break her. That if it wasn’t, it already had. “No.”</p><p>“Then stop trying to make it smaller than it is.”</p><p>Helena blinked. “I’m not—”</p><p>“You are,” Helly said softly, but without backing down. “You’re trying to find a reason or a cause or <em> something </em>to explain this away.”</p><p>She wasn’t wrong. </p><p>“I don’t know what this is,” Helena whispered. “I’ve never felt anything like this. For anyone. It’s like you’re a knife and if I try to pull you out I’ll just, I don’t know. Get blood everywhere. Die, maybe.”</p><p>Helly leaned in, kissed her jaw. “Such a poet.”</p><p>“It’s really fucked up, Helly.”</p><p>“You’ve mentioned that a few times.”</p><p>“Doesn’t that bother you?” </p><p>Helly didn’t answer right away. Her gaze drifted over Helena’s face, unreadable, calm. “I think it would bother me more if it didn’t feel so good,” she said finally.</p><p>Helena’s stomach twisted.</p><p>“Not just the sex,” Helly added, brushing Helena’s hair behind her ear. “Everything. Being close to you. Talking to you like this. Feeling like something in life finally makes sense again.”</p><p>Helena blinked. Her throat ached. “You don’t get scared of what would happen if we got caught? If people found out about what we’re doing?”</p><p>Helly smiled faintly. “Of course I get scared. But I’m not scared of <em> you</em>.”</p><p>That cracked something in her. Something shifted — a soft, barely-there tremble in her lips, the way her chest rose too sharply.</p><p>Helly noticed. Of course she did.</p><p>“Come here,” she whispered, tugging Helena back into her arms. “Just for tonight. Don’t worry. Just let me hold you.”</p><p>Helena buried her face in her neck. She didn’t say anything back. She just let herself be held.</p><p>⟡</p><p>Helena woke to warmth. Not the stiff, sterile heat of the academy’s recycled air, but something human. Helly’s arm was tucked under her shirt, hand resting against her back. Her breath was soft against the crook of Helena’s neck, steady and close. It felt like waking up five years ago. Only warmer, and worse — because now, she knew what it was to lose it. The absence had turned comfort into need.</p><p>For a moment, she didn’t move. It was still early — the light just beginning to filter through the slats of the blinds. The dorm was quiet. Silent, even. No movement in the halls. No Natalie. She could pretend, just for a second, that this was normal. That she was waking up next to someone she loved, in a place that allowed it.</p><p>Then Helly stirred behind her, letting out a quiet groan. Her fingers curled slightly against Helena’s spine. Helena smiled, feeling light.</p><p>“You’re awake,” Helly murmured, voice thick with sleep.</p><p>“Barely,” Helena whispered.</p><p>They stayed like that for a long moment — still, breathing together.</p><p>“Can we stay like this forever?” Helly asked, half a joke.</p><p>Helena’s smile faded. “We have until tomorrow night.”</p><p>Helly went quiet.</p><p>Helena felt Helly’s nails dig into her skin. Just slightly.</p><p>“Guess we better make it count.”</p><p>Helena shifted slowly, turning beneath the covers until she was facing her sister.</p><p>Helena could feel her cheek creased from the pillow. Her hair was a mess. Her eyes barely open. She looked impossibly soft in the morning light — younger, maybe. Gentler. She felt it, too.</p><p>Helly blinked at her, then smiled. “Hi.”</p><p>Helena smiled back. “Hi.”</p><p>They just looked at each other for a moment — barely inches apart, breath mingling in the quiet. Helly reached up and brushed a thumb over the bridge of Helena’s nose, lazy and affectionate.</p><p>“You always wake up this pretty?” she mumbled.</p><p>Helena rolled her eyes. “You’re such an asshole.”</p><p>Helly leaned in, kissed her — slow and soft and <em> sleepy</em>, nothing like the night before. Their lips barely moved at first, just pressed together, nearly ghosting, holding still in that one perfect point of contact.</p><p>Then again. A little deeper this time.</p><p>Helena felt her heart stutter.</p><p>It wasn’t about sex. Not just. It was about feeling close. Whole. Skin against skin, chest to chest, the kind of contact that made it hard to remember a time before this. A time where they ever let the world drive them apart.</p><p>Helly’s hand slid into her hair. They kissed again. And again. Until it was almost too much, too tender. Until Helena had to pull back just to breathe.</p><p>They stayed tangled together under the covers, legs draped lazily, foreheads brushing every now and then when one of them shifted.</p><p>“If you had to pick one place to disappear to,” Helly started, voice low against Helena’s collarbone, “where would you go?”</p><p>Helena blinked. “Disappearing implies I’d be running from something.”</p><p>“You would be.”</p><p>“Oh.” A pause. “Then maybe… Iceland?”</p><p>Helly pulled back just enough to look at her. “Iceland? Really?”</p><p>“Sure, why not? Big, empty. Beautiful. No one asking me to do anything. Plus the language sounds funny.”</p><p>Helly laughed, soft and warm. “Weirdo.”</p><p>“You asked.”</p><p>“I know.” She smiled. “It was a good answer.”</p><p>“What about you?”</p><p>Helly didn’t hesitate. “New York.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“I want to disappear into a place where no one gives a shit about me. Just… noise. Motion. People doing things that have nothing to do with our family name.”</p><p>“New York makes sense for you," Helena nodded, thinking. "You’d probably meet some artsy girl with BPD and fall in love in, like, two weeks.”</p><p>“Maybe,” Helly grinned. “Unless I was already in love with someone else.”</p><p>A beat. Silence that swelled. Thick, loaded.</p><p>Helena reached for something easier. “What’s your favorite color?”</p><p>Helly blinked. Her smile faltered, just slightly. “That’s… random.”</p><p>“I want to know,” Helena said, a little too quickly. “Is it still blue?”</p><p>Helly let out a quiet laugh, her features softening. She leaned in without thinking, bumping their noses in a gesture so familiar it almost hurt. “Maybe when we were ten,” she grumbled. “It’s been green for years.”</p><p>“Forest or emerald?”</p><p>“Emerald.”</p><p>Helena nodded, tucking that fact somewhere deep in her chest like it was precious.</p><p>“You?” Helly asked.</p><p>“Same as when we were kids,” Helena responded, challenging <em> her </em>for once.</p><p>Helly squinted slightly. “Remind me?”</p><p>“Don’t tell me you forgot?”</p><p>“Okay,” Helly said with a shrug and a grin. “I won’t.”</p><p>Helena gasped, mock-offended. “You <em> did </em> forget!” She reached out and gave Helly a gentle shove on the shoulder. Helly let herself fall back dramatically, limbs splayed like she’d been struck.</p><p>Helly tilted her head. “Red?”</p><p>“Yellow.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Sunflowers. Lemons. The trim on your favorite sweater.”</p><p>Helly stilled, blinking. “You know which one’s my favorite?”</p><p>Helena gave her a look. “Obviously.”</p><p>Helly’s expression shifted — not with surprise, but with recognition, like another question she hadn’t asked had just been answered. “God,” she whispered. “You’re deep in this, aren’t you?”</p><p>Helena leaned in and kissed her like a flame that had spent years looking for something to burn.</p>

  <p>They’d been awake for over an hour, but neither had moved much. Helly lay with her cheek resting against Helena’s collarbone, one leg tangled between hers, hair soft and messy and warm. Every so often she shifted, just slightly, like she couldn’t quite get comfortable.</p><p>Helena stared at the ceiling, blinking slowly, afraid to break the spell. Her body felt loose and sore, the kind of ache that reminded her she was alive. She’d never let herself be this close to anyone before, and the fact that Helly hadn’t pulled away yet felt dangerous. Addicting.</p><p>She let her hand drift lazily through Helly’s hair, tracing lazy arcs at the nape of her neck. Helly hummed contentedly, almost like a purr. Helly shifted beside her, propping her chin on Helena’s shoulder. “Let’s do something stupid.”</p><p>Helena blinked. “Define stupid.”</p><p>“I dunno. Skip chapel. Blow off our schedule. Sneak off campus. Take the train into town. Something irresponsible.”</p><p>Helena tilted her head slightly, just enough to see her. “Yeah, that is pretty stupid. We’ll get caught.”</p><p>Helly shrugged. “Maybe. Probably not. Who cares.”</p><p>“I care,” Helena scoffed, but it was half-hearted. Her voice lacked conviction. Like she was already picturing it.</p><p>Helly leaned in closer. “Come on. It’s senior year. One month left. We’ve been perfect little daughters of legacy for how long?”</p><p>“Nineteen years,” Helena said, deadpan.</p><p>“Exactly. Don’t you think we’ve earned one day that belongs to us?”</p><p>Helena didn’t answer. She stared at the ceiling, jaw tight. Her body was still humming from the night before — from Helly’s skin on hers, from the kind of closeness that made her mind go quiet for once. Helly’s fingers traced slow, lazy circles on the inside of her wrist — a reminder of how little she had to do to make Helena feel high.</p><p>“I want to make a memory,” Helly said, voice soft now. “One that’s just ours. Not attached to any of this.”</p><p>“You don’t think last night counts?” Helena said, trying for levity, but it came out hoarse.</p><p>“Last night was perfect,” Helly said. “That’s why I want more. Something stupid and reckless and <em> ours. </em> Come on. Please.”</p><p>Helena closed her eyes. She already knew she was going to say yes. The part of her that said no was shrinking — eaten alive by the part that couldn’t imagine going back to feeling numb. To being good.</p><p>“This is a really fucking bad idea,” she whispered.</p><p>“Yeah,” Helly grinned. “Isn’t it great?”</p><p>Helena let out a slow breath. Her heart thudded, sharp and sweet. She rolled onto her side to face her, brushing hair out of Helly’s eyes. “You’re going to get us expelled.”</p><p>Helly smirked. “They won’t expel the Eagan twins. Worst case, we get a strongly worded lecture and an essay assignment.”</p><p>“And a call to Father.”</p><p>“I’ll take the fall,” Helly offered, too easily. “I’ll say I pressured you.”</p><p>“You <em> did </em> pressure me.”</p><p>“Exactly. The truth is our best defense.”</p><p>Helena laughed quietly — stunned at herself for going along. She shook her head, already tasting the rush of it. “I hate you.”</p><p>Helly grinned, triumphant, and kissed her. Quick. Bright. Like punctuation. She sprung out of bed theatrically, stretching like the world was all hers. “Shower?”</p><p>“Meet you in five?” Helena asked, rolling onto her stomach.</p><p>Helly took advantage of her new position to smack her ass. “I’ll be there in four.”</p><p>⟡</p><p>The bathroom filled with steam faster than it should have. The tile was already sweating by the time Helena stepped in, goosebumps breaking under the heat. Helly was standing under the spray, back to her, hair soaked and darkened. She didn’t turn around. Just reached for the body wash like this was any other morning.</p><p>Helena climbed in slowly, closing the glass door behind her. Her skin prickled — from heat, from nerves, from want. She didn’t know what she expected, but the casualness of it all felt dated. It reminded her of when they used to bathe together. Innocent. She wasn’t sure when that got corrupted. Long before Helly stuck her thigh between her legs. Trying to pinpoint it made her feel dizzy.</p><p>“Here,” Helly said, and offered her the soap without looking. Her voice was neutral, nothing to indicate they were naked, pressed in a tight space, traces of each other still on their lips.</p><p>Helena took it anyway. Lathered her hands slowly. She watched the way the suds slipped between her fingers and thought cliché things about purity. Undoing. How nice it would be to wash more than dirt away.</p><p>Helly turned around — slowly, deliberately — and the air left Helena’s lungs.</p><p>Water slicked down the center of her chest, traced her stomach, gathered in the curve of her hip. She didn’t move to cover herself. Didn’t flinch under Helena’s gaze. Just waited. Expectant.</p><p>Helena stepped forward before she realized she’d done it. Their bodies didn’t touch — close, but not yet. They could feel each other in the steam. She reached out, tentative, and let her soapy hands skim the slope of Helly’s shoulders. Over her collarbones. Down her arms. Helly’s breath hitched — barely — and Helena could feel the way her pulse jumped under her skin. She washed her carefully. Reverently. Like she was trusted with tending to the divine. Something radiant and ruinous, standing in her hands like flesh.</p><p>“You’re being very gentle,” Helly said, voice low, amused.</p><p>“You want me to stop?” Helena asked, fingers pausing.</p><p>“No,” Helly said. “I like it. It’s just funny.”</p><p>Helena hummed noncommittally and kept going — her hands moving over Helly’s ribs now, down the length of her waist, slow and methodical like she was trying to get it right.</p><p>“It’s just weird,” Helly continued, her tone light. “You’re so—” She sucked in a sharp breath as Helena’s hands slid up again, thumbs brushing over her nipples without warning. Her body jolted, barely, like a current had run through her. She cleared her throat. “—so good at this,” she finished, a beat too late.</p><p>Helena smirked, eyes still focused on what she was doing. “At showering?”</p><p>Helly laughed. “At pretending this isn’t what it is.”</p><p>“And what is it?” Helena asked, finally looking up from her body, meeting her eyes. Helly held her gaze. There was no tease in it now — just heat, and something close to panic.</p><p>“I don’t know,” she said. “But if you stop, I’ll kill you.”</p><p>Helena didn’t answer right away. She leaned in instead — slow, deliberate. Close enough that their noses almost brushed, close enough that Helly’s breath caught again.</p><p>Her lips ghosted just shy of Helly’s.</p><p>“You’ll have to kill me, then,” she whispered. And then, just like that, she dropped her arms and stepped back.</p><p>Helly blinked at her, dazed. Chest rising. Like someone had pulled the rug out from under her nervous system. “What,” she said flatly, “the fuck was that.”</p><p>“If we start having sex in here,” Helena said, already reaching for the shampoo, “we’re going to miss the train.”</p><p>Helly looked like she might throw something. Or scream. Or drop to the floor and beg. Her mouth opened, then closed, then opened again like she was buffering.</p><p>“It was <em> your </em> idea,” Helena reminded her, smug now.</p><p>Helly stared. Then huffed. Then climbed out of the shower with a dramatic roll of her eyes. “Fine. You can wash yourself,” she muttered, toweling off with sharp little motions. “I won’t be able to keep my hands to myself like you apparently can.”</p><p>Helena smiled to herself as she lathered her hair.</p><p>She wasn’t sure she could either.</p><p>⟡</p><p>They got back to the room wrapped in towels and warmth, hair damp, faces pink from the heat. Helena climbed into her bed while Helly rifled through her drawer, muttering to herself.</p><p>“I swear to God, if Natalie took my favorite shirt again…”</p><p>“She didn’t,” Helena said, already curled under the blanket. “It’s under your pillow.”</p><p>Helly paused. Looked. Found it.</p><p>“You’re terrifying.”</p><p>“I pay attention.”</p><p>Helly pulled on the shirt — not bothering with underwear, yet — and flopped onto Helena’s bed.</p><p>They lay on their sides, facing each other. Legs tangled without discussion. Hair leaving wet spots on the pillow.</p><p>“I think that shower rewired my brain,” Helly mumbled, eyes half-lidded. “Everything feels quieter.”</p><p>“Less guilt,” Helena said. “For now.”</p><p>“Don’t ruin it.”</p><p>“I’m not,” she said gently. “Just saying it’s nice. Being clean. Being close.”</p><p>Helly smiled, small and real. A beat.</p><p>“You’re thinking really loud,” Helly said.</p><p>“I’m not thinking.”</p><p>“You are. I can hear it.”</p><p>Helena shook her head but didn’t deny it. “I’m <em> trying </em>not to.”</p><p>“Good.” Helly leaned in closer, their foreheads almost brushing. “You think too much.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>Helly didn’t push. Just tucked her hand under Helena’s. Their fingers curled together on the mattress between them, palm to palm, thumb to knuckle, like they’d done this every day for years. At one point, they had.</p><p>Helena had spent so much of her life rigid, watching herself from the outside. Helly just <em> was</em>. Reckless, sometimes. Stubborn, often. But free. And here she was, lying this close, breathing the same air. Helena wondered if she could breathe her in deep enough to catch it. Like a virus. Like a cure. If she could inhale all the parts of herself Helly had taken and get them back without anyone noticing.</p><p>“Do you ever wish we could rewind?” Helena asked quietly, eyes still fixed on her. “Go back five years. Back to the estate.”</p><p>Helly blinked. “Sometimes.”</p><p>“We were better then.”</p><p>“No,” Helly said. “We were smaller then. We didn’t know how hard it was going to get.”</p><p>Helena nodded faintly. “I wish we hadn’t let them split us.”</p><p>“They tried,” Helly said. “But they didn’t win.”</p><p>“You sure?”</p><p>Helly turned her face just enough to brush their noses together.  A whisper of contact, an unspoken answer. “You’re in my bed.”</p><p>Helena gave the smallest laugh. “You’re in <em> my </em> bed.”</p><p>“Same difference.”</p><p>Helly pulled their joined hands up between them and kissed Helena’s fingers. One at a time. Slow and soft. Helena watched her do it. Let her. Didn’t look away. It was sickeningly romantic. Something she would’ve expected from a boyfriend, madly in love with her. Instead, it was Helly. It made her feel nauseous and safe all at once. She wondered if one of those feelings would start to fade over time. It scared her that she couldn’t be sure which one it would be.</p><p>She wanted to say something. She didn’t know what.</p><p>Helly looked up. “You’re thinking again.”</p><p>Helena smiled. “I can’t help it.”</p><p>They lay there for another minute — Helena staring at the ceiling, Helly staring at her.</p><p>Then Helly sighed, dramatic. “We need to get up.”</p><p>Helena didn’t move. “Why.”</p><p>“Because if we don’t, I’m going to try to fuck you again,” Helly said, already sitting up. “And then we’ll be late. And we’ll never get into town. And the fantasy of what could have been will stay trapped inside your beautiful, tortured little brain forever.”</p><p>Helena groaned. “You make it sound so tragic.”</p><p>“It is. You’re an artist of repression.”</p><p>“You’re an artist of <em> chaos</em>.”</p><p>Helly grinned. “Exactly. Let’s go do crimes.”</p><p>⟡</p><p>The train into town was mostly empty. A short trip — one usually reserved for academy staff commutes. The twins didn’t need to explain to the conductor where they were heading. It was implied. Understood. They were going home. </p><p>Kier, PE. Home to Lumon HQ. Home to the estate they rarely left during the first fourteen years of their lives. The fact that they weren’t going anywhere near their father — and that he had no idea they were leaving campus — was a small detail they didn’t bother disclosing.</p><p>Helena and Helly sat near the back, side by side, legs pressed close. The windows rattled. The landscape outside blurred. Academy fencing first giving way to trees, pale and tentative with new leaves, then to the long sweep of lake leading toward the city’s edge.</p><p>The train pulled into the downtown station with a groan of brakes. They stepped off and blended into the slow current of foot traffic, boots echoing on the pavement. Most of the storefronts were named after Eagans. Or Kier. Or one of the principles. Like they’d never really left campus.</p><p>Helly squinted at a coffee shop window decal shaped like Kier’s face. “Think he’d smite us for skipping devotional?”</p><p>“I think he’d smite us for existing.”</p><p>Helly snorted. “Fair.”</p><p>They ducked into the coffee shop mostly out of curiosity — the logo on the menu was a grotesque, stylized portrait of Kier holding a steaming mug. Inside, it smelled like burnt espresso and industrial cinnamon. </p><p>“I’m not ordering anything called<em> The Benevolent Roast</em>,” Helena muttered.</p><p>“Suit yourself. I’m getting a <em> Verve Cold Brew</em>.”</p><p>They left with cups in hand and wandered aimlessly for a while, slipping through pockets of sun and shadow, past a mix of glossy redevelopment and crumbling edge-of-town ruin. It was strange — this part of the city felt hollowed out, forgotten by progress. The further they walked, the quieter it got.</p><p>Then Helly stopped.</p><p>Helena turned. “What?”</p><p>Helly pointed with her chin. Tucked behind an old fence and some overgrown hedges was a narrow path. At the end of it, a stone building with stained glass windows darkened by dust. The doors were wide open. No signage. A church. Probably abandoned not long after the Eagans took over — after they all but replaced the religion they claimed to coexist with.</p><p>They pushed through the overgrown path, coffee sloshing in their cups. The air grew cooler as they stepped inside. The nave was stripped bare. No pews. Just light filtering through fractured glass, painting soft color on the floor. The silence was thick. Sacred in a way that had nothing to do with doctrine.</p><p>Helly’s voice echoed as she stepped toward the center. “You ever been in a real one?”</p><p>Helena shook her head. </p><p>“Me neither.”</p><p>Helly spun slowly in place, head tilted back, taking it in. Helena watched her — how small she looked under the vaulted ceiling. How much bigger she looked for daring to be here. They stood in silence for a moment, letting the light pass over them in shifting colors. The hush wasn’t awkward. It felt like being allowed to breathe.</p><p>“You want to confess anything while we’re here?” Helly teased.</p><p>Helena glanced over. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“I dunno, isn’t that something Christians do?” Helly wandered up the center aisle, boots echoing faintly on the stone. “Come into some sad little room and tell someone all the worst shit they’ve ever done?”</p><p>Helena sipped her coffee. “You think I’m gonna tell <em> you </em> my worst shit?”</p><p>“Why not?” Helly turned back, walking backward now, her grin sharp. “We’ve already done a bunch of it together.”</p><p>Helena laughed under her breath. She stepped forward, met Helly halfway in the slanted light from the stained glass. The dust made it feel like everything was underwater.</p><p>“I don’t think I have a <em> worst </em>thing,” Helena said finally. “I think it’s all just… small decisions that led me further from myself.”</p><p>Helly’s expression sobered. “Jeez. That’s dark.”</p><p>“Was I supposed to keep it light?”</p><p>“Yeah, I was setting you up for a joke,” Helly bumped her shoulder.</p><p>“Sorry,” Helena said. “You were always the funny one.”</p><p>“Yeah, and I knew that. My fault, really.”</p><p>Helena huffed a laugh and looked up at the ceiling — cracked, paint curling at the edges like something trying to molt. “If there is a god,” she said, “I don’t think he likes me very much.”</p><p>Helly tilted her head. “Maybe he’s just got bad taste.”</p><p>Helena looked back at her. “You’re saying you’ve got better taste than God?”</p><p>“I’m saying if he doesn’t like you, he’s wrong,” Helly said. “And also that he doesn’t exist.”</p><p>Helena supposed she agreed with that last part. It made more sense for her life to be a cruel coincidence than an elaborate setup. A random rupture in the universe, not some grand, intentional joke. In a strange way, that was comforting.</p><p>Helly stepped closer, gesturing to her. “Okay, now you say something devastating and ruin the moment.”</p><p>Helena shook her head, scoffed. “Am I really that annoying?”</p><p>Helly shrugged. “Yeah. But it’s endearing.”</p><p>Helena rolled her eyes, but didn’t look away.</p><p>“I mean it,” Helly said. “You ruin moments. You overthink everything. You always carry more than you should and then get mad when people don’t notice.”</p><p>Helena raised a brow. “Are you complimenting me or trying to get me to kill myself?”</p><p>“Both. Obviously.” Helly stepped even closer. “Do you want to fuck in this abandoned church?”</p><p>Helena blinked. “You’re actually insane.”</p><p>Helly grinned. “You say that like it’s not the main thing you love about me.”</p><p>Helena squirmed. Looked away, then back. “It’s not <em> not </em> the main thing.”</p><p>Helly took another half-step, close enough now that Helena could feel the warmth radiating off her — even through her jacket, even through everything else that had always kept them just this far apart.</p><p>“No one’s here,” Helly’s voice was low, conspiratorial. “No one will be.”</p><p>Helena’s breath caught. Her heart was pounding in her throat now, embarrassingly loud in her own ears. “We <em> really </em>shouldn’t,” she said.</p><p>“Yeah,” Helly agreed easily. “That’s half the appeal.”</p><p>Helena didn’t move. Her coffee cup was trembling slightly in her hand.</p><p>Helly gently took it from her, set it down on the stone ledge beside them. Her fingers brushed Helena’s as she did it — just lightly — and the contact was enough to make her feel crazy. “What are you doing to me?”</p><p>Helly leaned in, voice low. “Same thing you’re doing to me.”</p><p>Helena let out a shaky breath. “I feel like I’m about to combust.”</p><p>“That’s the Holy Spirit,” Helly whispered, deadpan.</p><p>Helena laughed and pushed her shoulder. Her face burned. Helly saw it. Her expression shifted — softened just a fraction, enough to let sincerity bleed through the sarcasm.</p><p>“I want to touch you,” Helly said, quieter now. “Only if you want me to.”</p><p>Helena’s mouth was dry. Her own pulse nearly deafened her. “I do,” she said. “But not fast. Not… thrown against a dusty altar.”</p><p>Helly blinked, nodded. “Okay. Not fast.” She stepped back — just slightly — enough to give Helena room to breathe. Enough to let the moment settle instead of consume. “Wanna just… make out behind the altar like teenagers in a bad indie movie?”</p><p>Helena smirked. “<em>That </em> I can do.”</p><p>They stepped behind the cracked remains of what used to be the pulpit — now just a stone dais, dust-dulled and hollowed by time. The colored light from the stained glass cast fractured rainbow shapes across their skin.</p><p>Helena leaned back against the wall, heart thudding. Helly stepped into her space again — but slower now, patient. Like she was memorizing each inch of the moment. Taking a mental picture. Saving it for when she needed it. Hoping she never would. </p><p>Their lips met without ceremony. Just warmth. Familiarity. Need layered gently on top of comfort.</p><p>Helly kissed like she was writing something. Slow cursive. Helena responded like she was reading it, carefully, word by word. Hands at her waist. Hands in her hair. Learning each other. They weren’t rushing. </p><p>Helena let out a soft sound when Helly pulled her closer by the hips. That tiny noise — half-breath, half-plea — made Helly smile against her mouth.</p><p>“I love kissing you,” she mumbled, trailing her lips to Helena’s neck. “Especially the little sounds you make.”</p><p>The ache between Helena’s legs flared, sudden and sharp. “Okay, fine,” she whispered.</p><p>“Fine?” Helly pulled back just enough to look at her.</p><p>“Let’s fuck.”</p><p>Helly blinked. Then grinned. “That was easy.”</p><p>Helena leaned in again, but something shifted. Not in the kiss — in the air between them. A subtle recoil. Barely there. Something most people wouldn’t notice. But Helena wasn’t most people. Not with Helly.</p><p>She pulled back just slightly, eyes searching her face. “What is it?”</p><p>Helly blinked. “Hm? Nothing.”</p><p>“No, it’s not.” Helena’s voice was soft, but solid. “I know you. Don’t lie to me.”</p><p>Helly didn’t answer right away. Her jaw tensed. Her eyes dropped to somewhere near Helena’s collarbone. “It’s stupid.”</p><p>“Tell me anyway.”</p><p>A long pause. “I just worry I’m not enough for you.”</p><p>Helena’s brows knit. “What?”</p><p>Helly exhaled hard. Looked past her at the broken stained glass. “You’ve always liked boys. And this—” she gestured loosely between them “—this is natural for me. I’ve always liked girls. But for you it’s… different. And I can’t stop thinking about how I can’t give you what they can. Not fully.”</p><p>Helena’s stomach dropped. She took a breath. “Helly.”</p><p>Helly didn’t look at her. “Like, right now. I want to fuck you.”</p><p>“You can.”</p><p>“No, I mean, I want to <em> fuck </em>you. Pin you up against this wall and be inside of you. Finish together. All of that.”</p><p>“Okay, well, maybe when you move to New York you can buy a strap,” Helena said with a laugh.</p><p>“I’m serious, Helena.”</p><p>“Just use your fingers in the meantime,” she said bluntly, shrugging. “I think you’re overthinking this.”</p><p>“Are you attracted to me?”</p><p>Helena blinked, shook her head. “You’re fucking with me, right?”</p><p>Helly rolled her eyes. “Come on. The one time I want you to take something seriously.”</p><p>She stepped closer. “Yes, Helly. I’m attracted to you. I’m not fucking my sister because it’s a normal and expected thing to do.”</p><p>Helly’s jaw tensed. “I just don’t want you to feel like you have to do this. Like it’s a requirement to be close to me.”</p><p>“I’m not.” Helena’s voice dropped to something quieter. “You have no idea how long I’ve wanted this. How long I’ve wanted you.”</p><p>“How long?” she asked quietly.</p><p>Helena hesitated. The answer was right there. Ready. It had been circling her for years. But saying it aloud felt like handing over something sacred and shameful at once — something she’d tried to pray away to a God she didn’t believe in. She looked down at their hands, fingers barely touching. Her voice, when it came, was fragile.</p><p>“Since we were fifteen,” she said finally. “Or maybe fourteen. I didn’t know what it was then. I just knew that when they started separating us, it felt like something vital was being ripped out of me. And I missed you in a way I didn’t know how to explain.”</p><p>Helly was quiet. Her face was unreadable.</p><p>“I thought it would go away,” Helena continued.</p><p>“And it didn’t,” Helly finished.</p><p>Helena shook her head. “It only got worse.”</p><p>Silence stretched again — not empty, but full of all the years between them. All the versions of this conversation that never got to happen. Helly reached for her hand. Squeezed it. “I just wish I’d known.”</p><p>Helena laughed, barely. “Sorry I never told you. Not exactly an easy subject to broach.” They both laughed, tenderly, awkwardly. “What about you? How long?”</p><p>Helly's thumb brushed over Helena’s knuckles. “Since always, I think.”</p><p>Helena looked up, surprised.</p><p>“I didn’t have a name for it either,” Helly said. “Not until way later. But even when we were little, it was like... if something happened and I wasn’t the first person you told, I’d lose my mind. If someone else made you laugh, I’d get jealous. I just thought that was normal. That it was what being a twin meant.”</p><p>She smiled, but it was small. Earnest.</p><p>“It wasn’t until we got to the academy and I started feeling it in my body that I realized it wasn’t normal. That maybe I didn’t just love you. That maybe I was <em> in </em>love with you.”</p><p>Helena’s chest went tight.</p><p>Helly laughed under her breath. “I thought I was disgusting. I used to stay up all night trying to think of ways to stop it. To snap out of it. To fall for someone else.”</p><p>“Me too,” Helena whispered.</p><p>They sat in that, in the quiet horror and relief of having mirrored the same impossible secret for years — each of them too scared to speak it, both of them carrying it anyway.</p><p>“I’m glad it didn’t work,” Helly said softly.</p><p>Helena didn’t answer, but the look in her eyes said the same.</p><p>Helly shifted closer, knees brushing Helena’s. “Do you think it’s really that wrong?” she asked, voice barely above a whisper. “I mean… if we weren’t twins — if we were just two girls who loved each other — no one would blink.”</p><p>“But we <em> are </em>twins,” Helena said. She wasn’t sure if it was an argument or an admission. “Even if we don’t feel like it half the time anymore. Even though we were practically raised as two halves of one person. It’s still… looked down on. And not just by our family. By everyone.”</p><p>Helly looked down, thinking. “But, isn’t that what makes this make sense, too? Two halves of a whole? Like… it’s not just about sex or even love. It’s like I’ve always been reaching for something outside of myself to feel complete and it was you. It’s always been you.”</p><p>Helena swallowed. Her hands were trembling again. “So what do we do? Keep pretending this is temporary?”</p><p>“No,” Helly said. “I’m done pretending.”</p><p>Helena laughed once — sad, shaky. “Okay. So then what? We graduate. We go our separate ways. We write long, poetic letters and meet a few times a year in a hotel room?”</p><p>Helly gave a small, crooked smile. “Or we don’t go separate ways.”</p><p>Helena chewed on it. Really. For the first time, she actually considered it. “Where do we go?”</p><p>“Seriously, New York,” Helly nudged her. “Let’s say Father cuts both of us off. We get a shoebox apartment with a couple of roommates. We share a room. We work in coffee shops and wait tables and barely scrape together enough money for rent.”</p><p>Helena stared blankly. Processing.</p><p>“Look,” Helly continued. “It won’t be glamorous but it’ll be better than the academy and a hell of a lot better than Lumon. We’ll be free. <em> Together</em>.”</p><p>Helena looked down at their hands — Helly’s thumb brushing lazy circles over her knuckles like she was coaxing her forward. Like the future could be just as soft if she just leaned into it.</p><p>“No more marble floors,” Helena mumbled. “No more recitations. No more security gates.”</p><p>“No more Father,” Helly added.</p><p>Helena exhaled, deep and slow, like it hurt to let it out. “We’d still have to lie about what we are.”</p><p>“We’ve been lying for years,” Helly said, gently. “At least this time we’d be lying for ourselves.”</p><p>Helena nodded once, but her expression stayed unreadable. A war behind her eyes. Hope tugging at guilt, want tangled with fear. The kind of conflict that didn’t resolve in a moment but had to be lived through.</p><p>“I don’t know if I’m brave enough,” she said quietly.</p><p>“I am,” Helly said. “So I’ll be brave for both of us. Just until you catch up.”</p><p>Helena laughed — an actual laugh, this time. Soft and stunned, like it surprised her. “You always say shit like that like it’s no big deal.”</p><p>“Because it’s not a big deal,” Helly said, leaning forward.</p><p>Helena kissed her. It wasn’t heated or rushed. It didn’t burn. It spread — slow and warm and certain. A yes in the shape of her lips. A maybe in the shape of a future.</p><p>She kissed her like she was stepping into a promise. Like she could taste the life Helly had just described — secondhand furniture, mornings with burnt coffee, waking up pressed into each other. A life that terrified her and thrilled her in equal measure. A life that was real. The kiss stretched long and unhurried, like time had cracked open around them and was waiting patiently for them to decide.</p><p>“I want it,” Helena whispered. </p><p>Helly smiled. “Yeah?”</p><p>“I want to come home to you.”</p><p>Helly smiled. Not soft this time, but sharp, hungry. Something flickered behind her eyes. Something electric. Helena had seen that look before, but never this intense. Helly kissed her again — deeper now. Her hand slid to the back of Helena’s neck, fingers splayed wide, grounding her as their mouths moved together in a rhythm that already felt familiar.</p><p>Then lower. Her palm dragged down the front of Helena’s jacket, firm and deliberate, until it reached the hem of her waistband. Helena’s breath hitched. Her eyes fluttered open.</p><p>Helly slipped her hand beneath the fabric. The warmth of her fingers against her core made Helena gasp sharply.</p><p>“You’re already wet,” Helly laughed.</p><p>“You’re already ruining me,” Helena whispered.</p><p>Helly slipped a finger in. Felt how tight she was. “Has anyone ever done this to you before?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Have you ever done it to yourself?”</p><p>“No, I mean— not inside,” she breathed shakily, clenching around Helly’s finger.</p><p>“I’ll be gentle,” Helly added a second finger. Felt Helena exhale against her mouth. “Okay, just two then.”</p><p>“Yeah, two—oh, <em> fuck </em>—that works. Her knees buckled. One hand clutched Helly’s shoulder; the other flailed, searching for something to hold onto. Helly backed her into the wall. A soft whimper escaped Helena’s throat as her back met cold stone. Solid. Grounding. Something to anchor her, finally. Her thigh slid up along Helly’s hip, guided and held in place. She let herself be tilted open.</p><p>She fumbled at the wall again, fingers scraping smooth stone. Found no grip. Gave up and gripped Helly’s shoulder tighter. Then Helly curled her fingers. Helena jerked, trembling harder. “I don’t—” Helena started, then stopped. “I feel like I’m going to fall.”</p><p>“You’re not,” Helly said. She adjusted her grip, anchoring Helena’s leg with one hand, steadying her with her body. “Relax.”</p><p>“<em>Fuck</em>, Helly, I’m close.” Her voice cracked. “Seriously, don’t let me fall.”</p><p>Helly didn’t answer. She just pulled her tighter, pressing her into the wall. Her thumb found her clit and worked it in rhythm, deliberately.</p><p>Helena’s breath caught — sharp and shallow — and then she was gasping. Clenching. Her whole body locking up around Helly’s fingers like it was too much.</p><p>“Helly—” she choked, eyes wide and unfocused.</p><p>It hit her hard.</p><p>Her legs gave out in an instant.</p><p>Helly wasn’t ready for the full weight. Helena slid halfway down the wall, knees folding awkwardly, thigh nearly slipping from Helly’s grip. Helly scrambled—one arm clutched under her, the other still between her legs, caught in the middle of Helena’s climax and the sudden weight of her body collapsing.</p><p>“<em>Shit</em>— hold on—” Helly’s voice broke. She fell to her knees, letting Helena sink into the floor without pulling away.</p><p>Helena shook through it — loud, guttural sounds she didn’t mean to make tearing out of her throat as Helly’s hand kept moving, slower now, coaxing her through every wave. Her hips jerked once, then again, face buried in Helly’s neck.</p><p>“I’m sorry—<em> fuck</em>— I can’t—” she mumbled against her skin, tears springing to her eyes from the sheer intensity of it. She was disoriented, wrung out, unraveling in real time.</p><p>“You’re okay,” Helly whispered, catching her breath too. “I’ve got you. I’ve got you.”</p><p>It was clumsy. Her jacket had ridden up, shirt bunched to her upper back. One of Helena’s knees dug into Helly’s ribs. Neither moved. They just stayed there, tangled and flushed and trying to remember how breathing worked.</p><p>Eventually, Helena exhaled hard through her nose. “I told you not to let me fall, asshole.”</p><p>Helly pulled her hand free and stood. She offered the other to help her sister up. “I didn’t expect you to ragdoll like that.”</p><p>“Then don’t make me come that hard.” Helena winced, rolling her shoulders. Her back stung. She lifted her shirt and turned slightly. “Did I fuck up my back? Am I bleeding?”</p><p>Helly leaned in, eyes scanning the scraped skin. “Nope. Just scratched. Surface-level. No tetanus shots needed today. You’ll live.”</p><p>Helena let out a sigh. “You want me to do you next? Maybe I can drop you on your head.”</p><p>They both laughed. Still breathless, still flushed, but lighter now. Whatever just happened had knocked something loose in both of them. They stared at each other. Helena tilted her head, expectant.</p><p>“Oh,” Helly said, catching on. “<em>Yes.</em> Obviously. Minus the part where you drop me on my head.”</p><p>Helena raised an eyebrow, a glint of perversity in her eyes. “Do you want me to go down on you?”</p><p>Helly blinked, then laughed softly. “Wow. You want to do that again already? Miss <em> Eagan</em>,” she pretended to be scandalized.</p><p>Helena groaned and rolled her eyes. “Nevermind. You ruined it.”</p><p>Helly was laughing harder now. “Oh, come on—”</p><p>Helena turned, already pretending to walk away. “Nope. Offer rescinded.”</p><p>“I take it back! I take it all back!” Helly called after her, still laughing. “<em>Very </em> interested in your proposition. Please continue.”</p><p>Helena glanced over her shoulder, lips twitching. “Beg harder.”</p><p>“Is that what we’re doing now?”</p><p>“Beg. <em> Harder</em>.”</p><p>Helly sighed theatrically. “Okay. Please. Touch me.”</p><p>Helena crossed her arms. “I don’t think you mean it.”</p><p>Helly stepped closer, voice dropping low. “You just came so hard you hit the floor.”</p><p>“And?”</p><p>“So if I say <em> please</em>, and maybe get on my knees a little—”</p><p>“Maybe?” Helena challenged.</p><p>Helly smirked. “Okay, I’ll get on my knees.” She dropped. “Please. You don’t even have to use your mouth. Just touch me. I’ll be fast.”</p><p>Helena towered over her, raising a brow. “How fast?”</p><p>Helly gave a shaky laugh. “Thirty seconds. Tops.”</p><p>Helena tilted her head, amused. “Confident.”</p><p>“Desperate,” Helly corrected. She rested her hands lightly on Helena’s hips, thumbs grazing the waistband of her pants. “You have no idea how turned on I am right now. Watching you fall apart like that— feeling you—” She trailed off, biting her bottom lip. Her voice dipped lower. “I’ve been ready to explode since you said my name like that.”</p><p>Helena didn’t speak right away. Just looked down at her — flushed, messy, still catching her breath but already lit up again.</p><p>Helly shifted her weight slightly, palms pressing more firmly against Helena’s thighs, kneading against her. “Thirty seconds,” she repeated, trying for casual, but her voice broke halfway through. </p><p>Helena's gaze dropped to the hands on her thighs. “Voice cracked,” she teased.</p><p>Helly smiled, tight and breathless. “Shut up.”</p><p>“I haven’t even touched you yet.”</p><p>“I know.” Her thumbs pressed harder into Helena’s waistband, gripping like she needed something to hold onto.</p><p>Helena moved slowly, deliberately, brushing Helly’s hair back from her face with one hand. The contact made her shudder. “You really think thirty seconds?”</p><p>“I’ll be lucky to make it twenty,” Helly admitted, eyes fluttering closed as Helena cupped her cheek. “I’m already—<em> fuck </em>, Helena— just touch me.”</p><p>There was no pretense now. No sarcasm. Just need. Pure and crackling.</p><p>Helena sunk to her knees. Dragging her hand lower, down the front of Helly’s shirt, down to her pants. Unzipping, unbuttoning, dragging it out, just to watch Helly tremble. Just to feel the tension wind tighter.</p><p>By the time her fingers slipped beneath Helly’s waistband, she was already soaked. She placed the pad of her index finger over her clit. Pressed down a bit. Didn’t move.</p><p>Helly gasped — sharp, loud. Her hands flew to Helena’s thighs again, gripping harder, grounding herself.</p><p>“Fuck,” she whispered. “You can literally— just— barely move—”</p><p>Helena did exactly that. Barely moved. And watched Helly unravel.</p><p>Helly gasped, her whole body jolting forward like something inside her had snapped. She bucked hard against Helena’s hand, chasing friction, grounding herself, digging her nails into her sister’s thighs. </p><p>“<em>Fuck</em>—” she cried, hips grinding against Helena’s fingers, up to her palm, helpless, frantic.</p><p>Helena kept the pressure firm and steady. Didn’t tease. Didn’t change rhythm. Just let her ride it. Let her fall apart.</p><p>Helly’s forehead dropped to Helena’s shoulder. Her breath hitched, shattered, as her thighs trembled and locked tight. She came hard — fast and desperate, like her body had been holding it back for too long and refused to wait any longer.</p><p>She kept moving through it, small, messy thrusts against Helena’s palm, riding the aftershocks, gasping Helena’s name like a lifeline.</p><p>Helena held her steady. Just watched. Watched the way her face contorted, flushed and wrecked. Watched the way her hips stuttered, slower now, each pulse softening. Only when Helly finally slumped forward did Helena slip her hand away.</p><p>“That was more like, fifteen seconds. From first contact to you finishing,” Helena teased.</p><p>Helly laughed into Helena’s shoulder, the sound muffled by her jacket. She tilted her head slightly. “I told you.”</p><p>“Aren’t you a little embarrassed?”</p><p>Helly finally looked up, hair in her face, eyes half-lidded. “Embarrassed?”</p><p>“I barely touched you. Was it really that good?”</p><p>Helly grinned. “Don’t flatter yourself.”</p><p>“You’re literally still twitching.”</p><p>“<em>Wow</em>,” Helly feigned offense. “You’re mean today.”</p><p>Helena shrugged. “You’re easy to pick on.”</p><p>Helly leaned in, her voice low. “Careful. I’m still too fucked out to defend myself, but give me five minutes and I’ll ruin your life.”</p><p>“You already did,” Helena said, flat.</p><p>Helly’s smirk faltered, softened. She took a deep breath and stood up, straightening out her clothes.</p><p>“I’m just messing with you.” Helena’s heart kicked. She could never tell if she was taking it too far.</p><p>“Hm? I know,” Helly said with a shrug. She offered a hand to help Helena up. One more soft kiss to seal the experience. “We should probably get out of here.”</p><p>⟡</p><p>They walked back through town with hands brushing, coffee cups long emptied and forgotten. The sun was lower now, casting long shadows that made everything look older. Tired. Helena kept sneaking glances at Helly like she still didn’t believe she was allowed to look.</p><p>When they reached the train station, Helena stopped short.</p><p>Two police cruisers were parked out front. Not idling. Parked. One officer stood with arms crossed near the ticket booth, another was pacing slowly along the platform. Both of them looked… bored. Like they were waiting for something.</p><p>Or someone.</p><p>Helly slowed beside her. “You think they’re just… here?”</p><p>Helena didn’t answer. Her gut had already knotted. Something felt off.</p><p>A third officer emerged from the shadow of the waiting area. He looked directly at them. Spoke into a radio clipped to his shoulder.</p><p>Helena’s stomach dropped.</p><p>“Shit,” Helly said, under her breath. </p><p>Helena was already backing up a step, instinctively, like that would make her smaller. Less visible. Less caught. But it was too late.</p><p>“Helena Eagan? Helly Eagan?” the officer called, crossing the platform now. “We’ve been asked to escort you back to campus. Your headmistress has expressed concern for your safety.”</p><p>“Concern,” Helly repeated, flatly.</p><p>Helena didn’t move. Another cruiser door opened.</p><p>“Come with us, please.”</p><p>Helly looked at Helena, jaw tight. “That’s probably not good.”</p><p>Helena couldn’t even speak. She just nodded. Slowly. Silently. She felt her whole body lock up with dread.</p><p>They sat in the back of the cruiser, hands folded in their laps. The seats were slick and cold, and the glass between them and the officers in front made the space feel smaller than it was. Neither spoke for half the trip back.</p><p>Then, in a voice so low it barely registered over the hum of the road, Helly said, “I can’t believe she actually called the fucking cops.”</p><p>Helena stared straight ahead. “Really? You can’t?”</p><p>Helly turned to her. “How much do you think she knows?”</p><p>Helena shook her head. “I don’t know.”</p><p>Silence again. The tires hummed against the road, soft and endless.</p><p>Helly leaned closer, their knees brushing. “They’re gonna separate us.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“Do you think they’ll call him?”</p><p>“Of course they will.”</p><p>Helena felt stupid. Really stupid. They didn’t have to go into town. They could’ve stayed in their room. Spent the whole weekend wrapped around each other, safe and invisible. She blamed herself. </p><p>It had always been her job to defuse Helly’s reckless plans — to be the brakes when Helly hit the gas. That was the pattern. That was the rule. She didn’t know why today was the day she broke it. Why she let herself feel untouchable in a world that never missed a chance to show her just how defenseless she really was.</p><p>Helly reached for her hand — just a small touch, pinkies linked between them on the vinyl seat. The gesture was barely visible, but it grounded her. Completely. Helena felt like she could cry from the sheer relief of it. From how little time they had left to be this close.</p><p>“I meant what I said,” Helly whispered. “We’re gonna get out of here and be together. I don’t care what it takes.”</p><p>Helena nodded slowly. “I meant it too.”</p><p>“Good,” Helly whispered back. “Just know they’re gonna try to get in your head. <em> He’s </em> gonna try to get in your head.”</p><p>“I know,” Helena sighed. She was well aware of the tricks. The guilt, the withheld praise, the manufactured shame. She’d spent nineteen years being broken in by them. She just didn’t know if she could withstand another blow.</p><p>The cruiser turned off the main road. The gates of the academy rose ahead like jaws.</p><p>Their hands slipped apart just before the car rolled to a stop.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>They didn’t speak as they were led back into the administrative wing. The only sound was the occasional static crackle from the officer’s walkie. The hallway outside Headmistress Cobel’s office felt colder than usual. Or maybe Helena was just clammy.</p><p>Helly was called in first.</p><p>Helena watched her disappear through the heavy wooden door, her mouth dry. The latch clicked shut behind her. The officer stayed outside, occasionally glancing at Helena. She stared at the wall across from her, trying to keep her expression blank. </p><p>Five minutes passed. Then ten.</p><p>She could hear the low thrum of voices behind the door, but couldn’t make out any of the words. Just tone. A rise, a fall. A sharpness that made her stomach twist. She focused on her breathing. On the cold bench beneath her. On not biting her fingernails down to the quick.</p><p>When the door finally opened, Helly stepped out like someone who’d just been pulled from a riptide. Her eyes were red. Her posture rigid. She glanced at Helena, just long enough to pass something between them — reassurance, or warning, or maybe just acknowledgment that this was happening. Maybe all of the above.</p><p>She gave a small nod. Barely there. Then she was gone, led down the hall without a word. Helena had no idea when she would see her next.</p><p>Helena stood. Her knees felt loose. She took a breath, stepped forward, and walked into the office. The door clicked shut behind her.</p><p>The office smelled the same as always — disinfectant and something faintly sweet, like wilting flowers left too long in a vase. The blinds were drawn. A single desk lamp cast long, unnatural shadows across the walls. She felt sick to be back here so soon.</p><p>Headmistress Cobel didn’t look up right away. She was seated at her desk, reviewing something behind a thin stack of papers. A pen in her hand, uncapped. Just barely calm.</p><p>Helena sat there, hands clasped in front of her. She didn’t dare fidget or speak.</p><p>Eventually, Cobel set the pen down with a soft click.</p><p>“Miss Eagan.”</p><p>Helena raised her chin. “Yes, ma’am.”</p><p>Cobel’s eyes met hers — steady, unblinking. There was nothing in them to hold onto.</p><p>A long pause. Cobel folded her hands. “You left campus without permission. You violated curfew. You skipped multiple scheduled programming blocks, including morning devotional, which you know is non-optional for students of your standing. And you were found, unsupervised, alongside your sister, in a district where your family name is... <em> particularly </em>visible.”</p><p>The emphasis landed like a slap.</p><p>Helena stayed still. </p><p>“There are eyes on this institution,” Cobel continued. “Eyes that expect a certain standard of excellence. Of decorum. Particularly from those who are meant to embody its values.”</p><p>Another pause. It stretched.</p><p>“Do you have anything to say for yourself?”</p><p>Helena’s throat felt tight. Her brain offered her a dozen rehearsed lines. None of them would matter.</p><p>“I made a mistake,” she said finally, controlled. “It won’t happen again.”</p><p>Cobel tilted her head slightly. “No. It won’t.”</p><p>There was no anger in her voice. Something colder. A kind of calculation — like she was still deciding what part of Helena to cut out first.</p><p>“You’ve been given more grace than most,” Cobel said. “More chances. More privacy. That will change now.”</p><p>Helena nodded. “I understand.”</p><p>“I hope you do,” Cobel said. “You will no longer be sharing a room with your sister.”</p><p>Helena swallowed hard. “Why?”</p><p>Cobel’s gaze snapped to her. Angry now. “You <em> know </em> why. Because she is a terrible influence on you. Your other roommate is gone for one day and you two are romping about town doing Kier knows what.” Cobel sighed. Took a deep breath. “The <em> interpersonal </em>relationships within the Eagan family are none of my concern. However, they are your father’s concern.”</p><p>Helena turned pale as a ghost. She opened her mouth to speak but nothing came out. It shouldn’t have surprised her that Cobel found out about the nature of their relationship, somehow. There were hidden eyes all over this place. She and Helly both knew it. They couldn’t stop themselves anyway.</p><p>“That being said, I would hate to give him a heart attack over the academy’s failure to preserve your innocence.”</p><p>Helena tilted her head. “You’re not going to call him?”</p><p>“I didn’t <em> say </em>that,” Cobel snapped. “I reserve the right to inform him about this incident. You are to be exemplary. Attend all of your classes. Graduate with distinction. Go on to Lumon. Serve next to your father.”</p><p>Helena pressed her lips into a straight line. Nodded. “Or you’ll tell him.”</p><p>“My, my. Aren’t you perceptive? Tell me, Helena, since we’re playing the guessing game, what do you think will happen to your sister if your father learns of your depraved behavior?”</p><p>Helena bit the inside of her cheek. Shook her head. “Cut her off, probably.”</p><p>“If only you were this engaged in your classes,” Cobel said sharply. “It is essential to the health of the academy, the global economy — the world — that Lumon is run with competence, both now and after your father is gone from this earth.” She got up, walked around her desk to lean into Helena. “Stay away from your sister. Perform your duties. And your father will live in blissful ignorance of his daughters’ debauchery. Understood?”</p><p>“Understood.”</p><p>“Dismissed.”</p><p>⟡</p><p>Helena didn’t go straight to her new dorm. She wandered instead — aimlessly, letting her feet carry her through the quietest corners of the academy. Through the west courtyard, past the lecture halls, beneath the chapel archway where the light always looked nauseatingly artificial.</p><p>She weighed her options the way she was taught: like a ledger. </p><p>Action. Consequence. Sacrifice. </p><p>Risk. Reward. Return.</p><p>If she ran, they’d both be cut out. Not just from the family, but from everything tethered to the name: the inheritance, the protection, the myth. There would be no legacy to hide behind, no shield from what the world would do to girls like them. Especially if word got out. If <em> he </em> found out.</p><p>She couldn’t imagine what that conversation would sound like. The voice that taught her what shame was speaking it back to her with righteous fury. The man who built her like a monument, cracking her open just to see what was inside. She couldn’t bear to be <em> known </em> like that. Not by him. </p><p>She would have to go back to Lumon. She would keep her head down and smile in photographs and speak at panels and walk through the glass doors like she belonged there. On holidays, she’d see Helly. And maybe once a quarter, she’d take a business trip to New York. She’d find a way to turn the impossible into something <em> almost </em>enough.</p><p>The next morning, Helena found a note in her locker.</p><p>Folded once. No name. Just a small, rushed scrawl she recognized instantly:</p><p>
  <em> auditorium. lunch period. please. </em>
</p><p>A quiet plea. A door half-cracked open. She folded it back with care and slipped it into the side pocket of her bag. She didn’t go.</p><p>She sat through lunch in the courtyard, picking at a wilted salad, the note burning against her leg like it was trying to rewrite her skin. She imagined Helly sitting in the dark auditorium, waiting in the silence, checking the clock. </p><p>It wasn’t that Helena didn’t want to see her. She wanted to see her so badly it made her want to rip her skin inside out. She hoped Helly would understand that this was their only option. </p><p>The next day, another note.</p><p>
  <em> at least write me back. cobel knows about us. we need to talk </em>
</p><p>Helena sighed. She felt paranoid about even doing this. How much contact between the two would cause Cobel to call their father? She ripped a page out of her notebook and held it in her locker, hoping nobody would notice. She wrote back:</p><p>
  <em> Let’s talk after graduation. No more letters, too risky. Sorry. </em>
</p><p>She slipped it into Helly’s locker and turned her brain on autopilot for the next month.</p><p>⟡</p><p>The weeks that followed passed in a strange kind of stasis.</p><p>They still lived on the same campus. Ate from the same dining hall. Attended the same assemblies. But Helena didn’t see her once. She was sure that was by design. Helena didn’t ask around. Didn’t dare. She couldn’t risk drawing attention. Couldn’t risk being caught missing someone she wasn’t allowed to love.</p><p>But God, she missed her.</p><p>Every night, she climbed into bed with one of Helly’s old sweaters clutched to her chest. It still smelled of her shampoo and something deeper, salt and skin and <em> her</em>. In her most painful moments of missing her, Helena would press her nose to the collar and try to remember the sound of Helly laughing. The feeling of holding her.</p><p>She dreamed about her constantly. Sometimes in vivid scenes. Sometimes in impressions. She’d wake up with the ache still blooming in her ribs and between her legs. With her body burning like it remembered something she couldn’t quite reach.</p><p>She didn’t write again. Couldn’t risk another note. She knew she was doing the right thing. She <em> knew </em>that. Protecting them both. But each day apart dug a little deeper. Each night she went to bed alone, the silence got a little louder.</p><p>She kept her head down. Finished her coursework. Sat through lectures like her body was there but the rest of her was already gone.</p><p>She counted the days until graduation like she was counting seconds until she could breathe again.</p><p>⟡</p><p>The auditorium looked warmer with parents in the seats. The marble floor had been polished to a high shine, banners strung across the rafters with the academy’s tenets etched in silver thread. Cameras clicked softly as the class of graduates filed in, row by row, uniforms perfect, spines straight.</p><p>Helena’s name card was next to Helly’s on the seating chart.</p><p>She approached her row slowly, heart loud in her chest, and saw Helly already seated — hair neatly curled, eyes scanning the crowd. When Helena reached her, Helly turned just slightly. Met her eyes. Smiled cautiously.</p><p>“Hi,” she whispered, barely audible over the murmur of the crowd.</p><p>Helena’s throat tightened. “Hi.”</p><p>They sat. Their robes brushed, knees nearly touched. They didn’t look at each other again for a moment. An abundance of caution. Just stared ahead as families trickled into the stands and staff took their places behind the podium.</p><p>“You look good,” Helly said eventually.</p><p>Helena smiled faintly. “You too.”</p><p>The pause that followed felt longer than it was. Like their bodies were trying to communicate through the charged space between them. Every instinct screamed to reach out and touch her.</p><p>“Cobel fucked everything,” Helly said under her breath, the noise of the crowd providing cover. “Are you still coming to New York with me?”</p><p>“Helly,” she shook her head. “You know I can’t.”</p><p>Helly let out a deep sigh. “I fucking miss you.”</p><p>“I miss you too.”</p><p>“I’ll come back to Lumon,” Helly said suddenly. She turned slightly, met Helena’s eyes. There was sorrow in her own. The kind that comes from defeat. “I’ve thought about it. If you can’t come with me, I’ll stay.”</p><p>“<em>No</em>,” Helena whispered, sharp and immediate. As forceful as she could be without drawing attention. “If we’re both trapped, then all of this was for nothing.”</p><p>“At least we’ll be trapped together.” The surrender in her voice made Helena’s bones ache — like her joints were locking up, stiffening under the slow chill of Helly’s soul cooling beside her. The fire was going out. Helena could feel it, inch by inch, burning lower. A feeling too familiar. Visceral.</p><p>She wouldn’t let it happen. She would die before she did.</p><p>“You have to <em> go</em>, Helly. You have to get out. Father’s old. He won’t be around forever. We just have to bide our time.”</p><p>“I’m not letting you go there alone,” Helly said, voice steady, controlled, the firmness almost hiding her fear.</p><p>“I can handle it,” Helena said as convincingly as she possibly could. She meant it. She always handled it when Helly couldn’t. And she knew Helly couldn’t. Lumon would rot her from the inside out. Turn her into someone unrecognizable. Turn her into Helena. </p><p>“I hate this,” Helly’s voice shook. Her face was open, cracked down the middle. Helena could read every word that wasn’t said. She knew how badly Helly wanted to flip the script. To be the protector, the one who stayed. To offer a sacrifice grand enough to make up for all the times Helena had taken the fall. For all the things that split them apart and carved their differences into stone. But she didn’t have the stomach for it. She never had. </p><p>Helena loved her more for it.</p><p>More bodies began shuffling into the auditorium. Stage lights buzzed on, pale and unforgiving.</p><p>“You’ll call me?” Helly asked, vulnerable. Ashamed.</p><p>“Of <em> course</em>,” Helena assured her. Desperately wanting to reach out and grab her hand. Seeking touch, comfort, for both of them. Such a simple, human act, denied. “Every day.”</p><p>“Will you move on if you meet someone?” Helly’s voice cracked, then hardened. She gritted her teeth. “Because I don’t think I can ever move on from you.”</p><p>“I won’t,” Helena said. Without hesitation. “I won’t.”</p><p>Helly nodded. Took a deep breath. “Okay. We’ll make it work, then.”</p><p>“We always do.”</p><p>The crowd around them was nearly finished gathering — last-minute arrivals settling in, noise rising and falling like tide. From a distance, the twins looked composed. Picture-perfect daughters of legacy. In reality, their whole world was barely stitched together, fraying beneath the weight of all they couldn’t have.</p><p>The lights dimmed. Cobel stepped up to the podium. Her heels echoed like a warning. A hush fell over the room as the ceremony began.</p><p>But Helena could still feel the warmth of Helly beside her. Steady. Radiating. The only real thing in a room built on performance. A system built on cruelty. She told herself it would be enough. That it had to be. Just for now.</p><p>Just until they could find a way out. Until they could freely name what this was. Until they could live a life that wasn’t handed to them, already written.</p><p>Something real. Something that belonged only to them.</p><p>⟡</p><p>The next time they saw each other was three months later, when Helena found an excuse to come to New York for a day. They met at a café in East Village, the kind with exposed brick and thrifted furniture, every wall crowded with art — not curated, just collected. Helly was already there when Helena arrived, sitting by the window. Her hair was longer now. She drummed her fingers against a chipped porcelain cup.</p><p>Helena sat across from her, trying to be casual. Trying to look like she spent the past three months doing anything but thinking about this moment. Seeing her closer now, Helly looked different. Not unfamiliar, just slightly rearranged. City air and solitude had worn into her like wind on stone.</p><p>“Hey,” Helly started, a smirk creeping up the side of her face.</p><p>“Hi,” Helena breathed. She didn’t know what to say. Three months away felt like forever. She was having trouble finding her footing. Trouble figuring out what they were and weren’t.</p><p>They had called each other in the meantime, of course, when Helena could take time out of her busy days. Wrote too. Helly loved writing letters — insisted on it. Said it was romantic, tactile, something they could hold when they couldn’t hold each other. Helena tried to keep up, but her replies were always a little delayed, her words never quite as open. Helly’s letters were messy, full of crossed-out lines and scribbles and doodles. Helena’s were neat, curated, the kind of thing that could be archived if things ever went terribly wrong.</p><p>They were still trying, she reminded herself. Still in this. Still something.</p><p>Helly reached across the table and took her hand without asking. Smiled. Her palm was warm, familiar, real in a way the rest of the world hadn't felt in months. The comfort of it was immediate, and just like that, the fear that they’d drifted too far apart felt ridiculous.</p><p>Still, she couldn’t help but feel anxious. It wasn’t out of the ordinary for sisters to hold hands, of course, but the way Helly held hers felt unmistakably intimate. A line drawn in ink instead of pencil. She worried someone would look too long and <em> see it. </em></p><p>“People mind their business here,” Helly shrugged, reading her mind, like she always did. “That’s the best part about living in the city. We’re anonymous.”</p><p>“I don’t think <em> we’ll </em> ever be totally anonymous,” Helena laughed. “Identical twins with bright red hair, daughters of the guy who runs the world? We stick out like sore thumbs. We still have to be careful.”</p><p>“We <em> are </em>being careful,” Helly assured her. “So careful that I barely get to see you.”</p><p>Helena pulled her hand back, reaching for her coffee instead, suddenly fascinated by the foam on top. The tension hung between them like steam off the cup.</p><p>“I’m doing the best I can,” Helena said finally. Her voice was quiet. Not defensive — just tired. “You know that, right?”</p><p>Helly exhaled. “Of <em>course</em>. Of course I know that. I’m sorry, I’m not trying to— you just got here. Let’s have a good day.”</p><p>Helena nodded, offering a small smile she didn’t fully feel. “Okay. A good day,” her voice was deep, a defense mechanism. She considered reaching for Helly’s hand again, but decided against it. She was having trouble relaxing — a paranoia she couldn’t quite shake. Every gesture felt like a risk now, the ratio to reward growing more lopsided with time. Inverted. Upside down.</p><p>“Okay,” Helly nodded, fidgeting. “Great. Well, there’s a museum down the road I wanted to show you—”</p><p>“Hey,” Helena cut her off. Helly’s mouth snapped shut. “Can I be honest?”</p><p>“Please,” Helly said, waving her hand with exaggerated flair.</p><p>“I really, <em> really </em> just want to go back to your place and—” she glanced around, casually but alert, making sure no one was close enough to hear. Then, mouthing the next word: “<em>fuck</em>.”</p><p>Helly grinned so wide her face was all teeth. She laughed — <em> really </em>laughed. She looked the most herself since Helena sat down.</p><p>“Wow,” Helly said, crossing her arms, leaning back. “Miss<em> Eagan</em>,” her tone faux-scandalized.</p><p>Helena rubbed the bridge of her nose. “I hate that. I hate when you say that.”</p><p>“I know. That’s why I say it,” her smile creeped higher, somehow. “Let’s go. I bought something just for the occasion.”</p><p>They walked back to Helly’s place just as the sun started to set. The air was humid and full of noise — car horns, muffled music, someone shouting across an avenue. It all felt distant. Muted. The sound of Helly’s boots clanking against the pavement was the only thing grounding her to the moment.</p><p>Helly reached into her bag and pulled out a cigarette, lighting it with practiced ease as they waited at a crosswalk.</p><p>Helena blinked. “You smoke now?”</p><p>Helly shrugged, exhaling toward the street. “I picked it up when I moved here. Stress, art school, et cetera.”</p><p><em> Stress</em>. She could’ve laughed. “I didn’t know,” Helena said quietly, judgement barely shrouded beneath her smirk. </p><p>“There’s a <em> lot </em>you don’t know about me now,” Helly replied, sarcasm dancing in her voice.</p><p>She offered the cigarette. Helena hesitated, then took it — because Helly was looking at her like it would be funny if she didn’t. She put it to her lips and inhaled too sharply. A second later she was coughing into her elbow, eyes watering. </p><p>Helly laughed. “God, you’re terrible at that.”</p><p>“What the fuck is wrong with you?” Helena wheezed, wiping her mouth. “Why would you do this to yourself?”</p><p>Helly leaned in, plucked the cigarette from her hand, and took a long, lazy drag — her eyes half-lidded, hair caught in the breeze, the whole thing unfairly cinematic.</p><p>Helena watched, stomach twisting. It was disgusting. It was stupid. It was the hottest thing she’d ever seen. She looked away, flushed, pretending to be interested in a sticker-covered streetlamp. “You look ridiculous,” she muttered.</p><p>“I look cool,” Helly corrected, blowing smoke up toward the skyline.</p><p>Helly took another drag, then let the cigarette hang lazily from her fingers as they crossed the street.</p><p>“You know,” she said, smirking without looking over, “this is the first time you’ve ever initiated it.”</p><p>Helena didn’t answer right away. Her cheeks were hot again. “That can’t be right.”</p><p>“You’ve <em> agreed </em> before,” Helly said, grinning now. “You’ve <em> allowed </em> it.”</p><p>“I kissed you first,” Helena corrected her, quietly.</p><p>“Kissing isn’t sex,” Helly looked smug, like she knew she already won. “I touched you first, every time.”</p><p>Helena gave her a look. “Will you keep your fucking voice down? I’m not doing this with you right now.”</p><p>“You <em> are</em>, actually,” Helly teased, bumping her shoulder as they climbed the steps to her apartment. She took one last drag, then crushed the cigarette under the sole of her boot. “And you’re doing great.”</p><p>Helly unlocked the door and pushed it open with her shoulder, stepping into the kind of organized chaos Helena remembered from their shared childhood bedroom — but matured, unfiltered, full-scale.</p><p>It was a studio, technically, but the space felt larger than it should. Every wall was claimed: stacked canvases leaning against bookshelves, mixed-media collages taped straight to the drywall, clusters of clay sculptures arranged like offerings on mismatched side tables. Poems printed on cardstock fluttered slightly beneath the ceiling fan, thumbtacked without frames. The whole place smelled like oil paint and cinnamon candles.</p><p>The couch was covered in throw blankets and notebooks. The furniture didn’t match — velvet, corduroy, plastic, wood. All of it full of life. All of it unmistakably <em> her</em>.</p><p>Helena stood in the doorway a moment too long.</p><p>Helly turned around, brow raised. “You coming in?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Helena said. She stepped inside.</p><p>Her heart ached a little. Full in one way, hollow in another. She was happy for her — she <em> was</em>. But the jealousy sat like a lump in her throat anyway. Sticky. Unswallowable. She swallowed it anyway.</p><p>“This place is…” she trailed off, scanning the space.</p><p>“A disaster?” </p><p>“No,” Helena said softly. “It’s you.” </p><p>Helly smiled and leaned in to kiss her — gently. Just once. A short kiss. Little more than a peck. A sweet little <em> I missed you</em>, pressed against her mouth. Something soft to hold them over until the main event. Helena ached for a thousand more.</p><p>She let her eyes sweep the room again, then gestured vaguely toward the walls, the sculptures, the stacks of sketchbooks. “Art school is keeping you busy, I see.”</p><p>Helly smiled, walking over to the foot of her bed. “Not all of it’s mine. I’ve made a lot of friends since I’ve been here. People leave stuff when they come over — trade pieces, hang things. It just… builds up.” She opened up a trunk and started ruffling through it.</p><p>Helena blinked. “You’ve never mentioned your new friends.”</p><p>Helly glanced over her shoulder, one eyebrow raised. “Well, you’ve never mentioned any of <em> yours</em>.”</p><p>Helena pursed her lips. She didn’t have any to mention. She nodded, as if conceding something silently, and turned her attention to a sculpture on the windowsill — something clay and half-glazed, a body without a head. “How’s the program?”</p><p>“It’s fine. It’s a lot of work. I’m not sure if I’ll drop out yet,” she responded, still ruffling, falling in deeper now.</p><p>Helena gritted her teeth. <em> Must be nice to have the option to just stop doing something when it becomes a little inconvenient. </em> “You should follow your heart,” she landed on.</p><p>Helly’s head snapped back so quickly she might’ve pulled a muscle. “Pfft, yeah. Okay. Fuck you too.”</p><p>Helena sighed. “I just think it might be good for you to learn a little discipline. To follow through with something.”</p><p>Helly rolled her eyes and started throwing articles of clothing out of the trunk, onto the floor. “I’d follow through with something if it made <em> sense </em> . I just don’t want my creativity corrupted by an institution that doesn’t even—” the lid of the trunk shut on Helly’s back. “Ow, <em> fuck</em>,” she slithered out, throwing the lid back open aggressively. “A little help please?”</p><p>Helena walked over and held the lid open while Helly went back to scouring, digging to the bottom. “What are you looking for, anyway?”</p><p>Finally, she pulled something out that made Helena burst out laughing. Helly gave her a smug smile. “This.”</p><p>It was a strap-on. Well, not exactly. It was strapless. A bulb that the wearer inserts on one end, a large silicone phallus on the other. Violently purple.</p><p>She wasn’t laughing at Helly. Not really. It was just so absurd. But the moment Helly’s smile faltered, the humor shriveled in her chest.</p><p>“Helly, that is <em> not </em>fitting inside of me,” she swallowed another laugh. “You know that, right?”</p><p>Helly chewed the inside of her cheek. “Really?”</p><p>Helena stopped laughing when she realized Helly was serious. “Oh, come on Helly.”</p><p>“No, it’s fine. It’s just— I bought this a few months ago when I first got here. For us,” she threw it back in the bottom of the trunk, piling her clothes back on top of it. “It’s dumb, sorry.”</p><p>Helena stepped forward and stopped her, putting her hands on Helly’s shoulders. She held her gaze. Helly looked vulnerable — open in that unguarded way Helena could never quite manage herself. She wanted to lean in and kiss her, but she needed to get her point across. “It’s not <em> dumb</em>. It’s too <em> big</em>. We can try it if you want, but I’m just warning you.”</p><p>Helly sighed, frustrated. So clearly trying to laugh it off, but unable. “I just want to fuck you how you want to be fucked.”</p><p>“Why do you think I want to be fucked that way?” Helena knitted her brows as she shook her head. She couldn’t understand Helly’s obsession with this.</p><p>“I’m just trying to make it feel as normal as possible for you,” Helly threw her hands up. “Fuck, Helena. I don’t know. You should be having boring missionary with some clean-cut Ivy League asshole, not weird lesbian sex with your sister.”</p><p>“What the fuck, Helly?” Helena stepped back. Her voice was low, tense. “Where is this even coming from?”</p><p>“I just feel guilty,” Helly admitted, voice quiet, tears forming. “I know this whole thing is hard on both of us, but it’s harder on you, and I just feel really fucking bad about it all the time.”</p><p>“Come here,” Helena pulled her into a hug and squeezed her as tightly as she could. She adjusted her grip to pull her even closer. She buried her cheek in the crook of her shoulder and kissed her neck gently. She felt Helly’s body shake, a tear fall onto her cheek. “I’m sorry if I do a bad job at showing it, but I want <em> you </em>. I don’t care about anything else.”</p><p>Helly didn’t speak. She just shook quietly in Helena’s arms, breath catching now and then like she was trying not to fall apart completely. Helena held her tighter. She knew this feeling — too well. The hollow ache, the grief of desperately wanting something that already felt doomed. She stroked Helly’s back, soft and steady, and let her cry.</p><p>A bitter, reprehensible thought rose in her chest: <em> Good. I’m not the only one being eaten alive by this. </em></p><p>She didn’t say it. She barely let herself think it. But the relief was there, a satisfaction as sharp as it was shameful. Finally, Helly pulled back, her face streaked with tears. Her eyes were red, her breathing uneven. Helena reached up and wiped the tears from her cheeks with the pad of her thumb, slow and careful, like the motion itself might undo the ache behind them.</p><p>Something swelled in her chest — protective, primal, almost violent in its clarity. She could’ve killed everyone who ever made Helly feel like this. Every person, every rule, every expectation that carved this pain into her.</p><p>Helly gave a weak laugh and wiped at her nose, sniffling. “Really setting the mood, huh?”</p><p>Helena snorted. “We don’t have to, you know… We can just stay in, watch a movie—”</p><p>“We <em> do </em> have to,” Helly cut her off. “Your flight leaves tomorrow morning and we don’t know when we’ll see each other next.” She paused for a moment to look at Helena with urgency. “We have to. We <em> have </em>to.” Her voice cracked, her body language frantic, panicked. “Fuck, we—”</p><p>“Okay, just calm down—”</p><p>“No.” </p><p>Helly lunged forward and kissed her. Her face was still wet, her tears smearing across Helena’s cheeks. It wasn’t graceful. Helena kissed her back — hungrily, stupidly — as if desire could muffle out the sound of the cracks. As if pretending it wasn’t falling apart might be enough to hold it a little longer. And the longer she kissed her, the more desperate it became, the more she believed there was some truth to that.</p><p>Helly pulled back just enough to mutter a confession against her lips. “I touched myself every night thinking about this,” she whispered. Another kiss — deeper, messier. “About you.” </p><p>Helly’s hands trailed up Helena’s waist, trembling as they slipped beneath her shirt, up her back, unclipping her bra. “I thought if I could come hard enough, I’d stop missing you so much.”</p><p>Helena moaned into her mouth. “Did it work?”</p><p>Helly yanked the shirt over her head, the bra with it. “No.”</p><p>Helena crashed into her so hard she could’ve broken her nose. Pulled back just enough to breathe. “Get the strap.”</p><p>Helly scrambled through the trunk again, her hands shaking slightly. Helena stood bare from the waist up, skin flushed, chest rising and falling like she couldn’t catch her breath.</p><p>“Hurry up,” Helena snapped, her voice wrecked with want as she slid the rest of her clothes off. “Please.”</p><p>“I’m going as fast as I fucking can—<em> ah </em>.” Helly pulled the toy from the bottom, holding it up like a prize. “Found it.”</p><p>Helena dropped onto the bed, legs already spreading, pupils blown wide. “Get over here and fuck me.”</p><p>Helly paused. “Okay, I’ve never actually used—”</p><p>“Figure it out.”</p><p>There was nothing flirtatious in Helena’s voice. No smirk, no teasing. Just <em> need</em>. As if fucking hard enough might exorcise everything they couldn’t say.</p><p>Helly tore her clothes off as quickly as she could. She fumbled, trying to seat the bulb inside herself, hands slick with lube and nerves. “God, this thing is ridiculous,” she muttered, trying to adjust the angle. “Is this even—”</p><p>“It’s upside down.”</p><p>“Oh my <em> god</em>, don’t look at me.”</p><p>Helena’s voice cracked on a laugh — sharp, breathless. “This is your fault.”</p><p>“It’s always my fault,” Helly said, voice dry, but her hands were steady now. She inserted it slowly, grimacing slightly. “Okay. Got it. I think.”</p><p>She climbed onto the bed — not graceful, not seductive. The toy jutted out from her body, bobbing slightly with every shift of her hips, the bulb inside her keeping it seated, full, strange. She moved like she wasn’t used to it — because she wasn’t. Her thighs were tense around it, adjusting as she knelt between Helena’s legs.</p><p>Helena stared at the slick curve of silicone between them. At the way Helly shifted to find her balance, breathing hard through her nose.</p><p>“What?” Helly said, chest rising and falling. Her voice wavered, like she might start laughing. Or crying. “Don’t look at me like that.”</p><p>Helena reached for her, pulled her in.</p><p>Helly kissed her — slow at first, all mouth and breath, until her hips rolled forward, unthinking, dragging the shaft between Helena’s folds.</p><p>They both gasped. The pressure was soft, wet, <em> frustrating</em>. The toy nudged Helena’s clit on the next pass and she jolted beneath her, clutching at Helly’s back.</p><p>“Jesus,” she hissed.</p><p>Helly grinned against her mouth. “That feel good?”</p><p>“Keep going.”</p><p>They didn’t rush. They ground together like that for a while, uncoordinated, hands slipping on each other’s skin, the toy slick and clunky between them. </p><p>“Okay,” Helena breathed finally, pulling back just enough to look her in the eye. “Put it in.”</p><p>“Okay,” Helly nodded, breath hitching, and reached down to guide the toy. “Fuck, is this even gonna fit?”</p><p>“I don’t know. Just try.”</p><p>Her fingers trembled slightly — from nerves or the effort of keeping the angle steady, she didn’t know.</p><p>It slipped once. Then again.</p><p>“Sorry,” she muttered.</p><p>Helena shook her head, chest heaving. “It’s fine. Don’t be.”</p><p>The third time, it caught. Pressed in just enough for Helena’s mouth to fall open in a soft, broken sound. It was sharp, painful, too much. She needed more.</p><p>“Okay,” she whispered. “Keep going.”</p><p>Helly pushed in slowly — not out of hesitation, but because she had to adjust, hips shifting, her whole body working to stay locked in. She pushed in further. It didn’t feel natural. It felt too full, invasive.</p><p>Helly stopped. Took a beat. Checked in with her eyes. </p><p>“Don’t fucking stop, Helly.”</p><p>Helena’s hands were everywhere — gripping Helly’s waist, dragging down her back, pulling her in deeper. Nails biting into skin. She groaned as Helly bottomed out, head tipping back into the mattress.</p><p>“Fuck,” Helly breathed. “Jesus. Are you okay?”</p><p>“Just keep going,” Helena begged. “Whatever you do— don’t stop.”</p><p>Helly found a rhythm — messy, uneven, too much friction and not enough practice — but Helena <em> took it</em>, pulled her closer, coaxed her deeper. Every thrust made the toy slip slightly; Helly had to readjust again and again. It wasn’t pretty. It wasn’t seamless. But it was <em> theirs</em>.</p><p>They kept going. Ten minutes, maybe more — time lost in the slick sound of skin, in breathless gasps and the rhythmic slap of bodies trying to make sense of each other.</p><p>She wasn’t close. Not really. Her body responded, sure — clenched, opened, shook when Helly hit a good spot. The mixture of pain and pleasure quieted her mind, or at least provided a nice distraction. But there was no wave building. No edge. Just friction and heat and the overwhelming feeling that this <em> should’ve </em> felt like enough.</p><p>“Do you think,” Helena asked, breath catching, “you’ll be able to finish like this?”</p><p>Helly’s forehead rested against hers. Helena could feel her smile before she heard it. “Not a chance.”</p><p>It was obvious. Helena didn’t know why she’d even asked.</p><p>Helly pulled back, just slightly. “What about you?”</p><p>“Maybe,” she lied. “I don’t think so,” more truthful.</p><p>Helly kept moving — slow now. “I’m sorry I’m not very good at this.”</p><p>“It’s okay,” Helena whispered. Her fingers traced Helly’s spine. “I just want to feel close to you.”</p><p>Helly lay her body weight on top of her, burying her face in Helena’s neck, kissing her softly as she continued to thrust into her — slow, steady now, bodies slick and breathless. The rhythm was starting to fray again. Helena’s jaw was clenched. Her hands trembled on Helly’s arms. She wanted it so badly her skin felt electric, but her body wouldn’t give.</p><p>Helly must’ve felt it too. She shifted, bracing herself with one arm, and brought her free hand down between them. Her fingers found Helena’s clit — clumsy at first, too much pressure, not the right angle.</p><p>Helena flinched. “Wait—slow. Softer.”</p><p>Helly adjusted instantly, her breath catching as she found the rhythm.</p><p>“Like that?” she whispered.</p><p>Helena nodded, forehead pressed to Helly’s shoulder. “Yeah. Yeah, like that.”  Her body started to respond almost immediately — not with a jolt, but a slow thrum. Her hips rolled upward on instinct, chasing the pressure. The friction inside matched the rhythm outside. Finally, <em> finally</em>, it lined up.</p><p>“Oh my god,” she breathed. “Just— just like that, don’t stop—”</p><p>“I’ve got you,” Helly murmured. “I’ve got you.”</p><p>Helena was shaking now. Her thighs tensed. Her nails dragged down Helly’s back again — it must’ve looked raw by now. “I think I’m close.”</p><p>“Yeah?” Helly’s voice was thick. “Come for me.”</p><p>Helena’s breath caught, her body tightening around the toy. The circles on her clit stayed steady, just light enough to let her rise into it without slipping. Her hips rolled again, chasing, chasing—</p><p>“I’m gonna,” she gasped. “Don’t stop— don’t—”</p><p>Her voice cracked. She buried her face in Helly’s shoulder, one arm thrown around her back, the other fisted in the sheets.</p><p>It hit like an earthquake. A collapse.</p><p>Her body seized, locked up, and she came with a quiet, keening sound that felt like it had been living in her throat for months. Maybe years.</p><p>Helly kept holding her. Kept moving through it. Kept whispering, <em> “That’s it. That’s it. I’ve got you.” </em></p><p>Helena couldn’t stop shaking. Her hands, her legs, her mouth — everything trembled as the last of it rolled through her. And then: stillness.</p><p>Not peace. Not clarity. Just stillness.</p><p>Helly lay on top of her in silence for a few moments. Dead weight, still inside her, completely spent. Her breath warmed the space between them. Neither of them moved.</p><p>Finally, Helly pulled back — slowly, carefully — and eased the toy out of Helena, then out of herself. She held it in the air for a beat, dangling it by the base, looked at it like it might suddenly offer her instructions.</p><p>Then she turned, walked naked and unsteady to the bathroom, and disappeared for a moment. Helena stared at the ceiling, mind empty for the first time in her life.</p><p>When Helly came back, she tossed herself onto the bed like her bones had given up on structure entirely. They lay there for a long time, tangled up and cooling off, neither of them saying anything. The air smelled like sweat and sex and candle wax that had burned itself out. Helly's arm was draped across Helena's stomach. Her breathing had started to even out.</p><p>Helena spoke first, voice low. “That was… <em> really </em>good.”</p><p>Helly snorted softly into the crook of her neck. “It was a disaster. And fucking exhausting.” </p><p>Helena smiled, barely. “Maybe for you.”</p><p>Helly tilted her head just enough to look at her. Her eyes were half-lidded, her lashes sticky with sweat. “Hey. Are you okay?”</p><p>Helena nodded, after a second. “Yeah. You?”</p><p>“I’m just happy you finished.”</p><p>“It would’ve been okay if I didn’t,” Helena ghosted her lips. “And I didn’t forget about you either.”</p><p>Helly huffed a laugh. “It’s fine. I’m good.”</p><p>“You’re not,” Helena challenged. “I know what you sound like when you’re good.”</p><p>She shifted slightly, her thigh sliding between Helly’s legs, deliberate and slow. The skin there was still damp with sweat — warm, smooth, solid. Helly sucked in a breath as the contact landed, slick. Not expecting it.</p><p>Helena didn’t say anything else. She just pulled her closer by the waist and guided her to grind against her.</p><p>Helly’s hips twitched, once. Then again.</p><p>“Helena,” she whispered. “You really don’t have to—”</p><p>“I want to.”</p><p>Helly started moving, slow and searching, her breath catching in her throat. The friction was subtle — not enough to overwhelm, just enough to build. Her clit dragged along Helena’s thigh, and Helena flexed her leg slightly in response, giving her something to push against. It was so much softer than what they had just done. All closeness, no sharp edges. Sickeningly intimate. Quiet. Just the sound of skin, and breath, and the soft creak of the bed.</p><p>Helly buried her face in Helena’s neck. “You’re gonna make me cry.”</p><p>“Go ahead,” Helena said softly. “Just let go.”</p><p>Helly moaned — broken, grateful — and picked up her pace. Helena held her steady. Kept whispering. Kept breathing with her. Kept her close.</p><p>Helly’s breath hitched. Her movements grew less controlled — stuttering, desperate, friction chasing sensation. Her fingers dug into Helena’s back.</p><p>Helena kept her there. Steady. Solid. Present.</p><p>“That’s it,” she whispered. “I’ve got you.”</p><p>Helly let out a sound like a sob — muffled against her throat — and came hard, shaking against her, legs clenching around Helena’s thigh as if she could fuse with her and never be separate again.</p><p>Helena didn’t move. She just held her. One hand at the back of Helly’s head, the other resting over her spine, rising and falling with every uneven breath.</p><p>Helly pulled back, cheeks stained with new tears, and gazed into Helena’s eyes like she was trying to tell her something telepathically. Or maybe ask her something. She couldn’t quite parse it.</p><p>“You’re a fucking mess tonight,” Helena teased her instead. It was easier than figuring it out.</p><p>Another beat.</p><p>“I’m in love with you, by the way,” Helly’s voice cracked a little. “Deeply. Madly. If it wasn’t obvious.”</p><p>Helena blinked. Swallowed. The words sat between them, warm and heavy, like something alive. Something dangerous. Something that would eat them both if they weren't careful.</p><p>“It was,” Helena said, shaking her head. She was caught off guard. And selfish enough, in that moment, to want to stay in something beautiful without being asked to name it. Without being asked for more. “You didn’t have to say it.”</p><p>“I did,” Helly whispered, brows knitting, a new edge to her voice. “Because you never will.”</p><p>Helena sighed. Looked away. Not far — just over Helly’s shoulder, at the tangled sheets or the crack in the ceiling or nothing at all. She felt it in her chest. That slow, unbearable tightening. The one she’d been outrunning since the moment she first realized she wanted Helly in a way she was never supposed to.</p><p>“I know you want to say it,” Helly said, frustrated now. “I just don’t understand why you won’t.”</p><p>Helena swallowed. She bit the inside of her cheek hard enough to almost draw blood. Not quite.</p><p>“It’s not that I don’t feel it,” she said, finally. “You know me, Helly. You know why this is hard.”</p><p>Helly blinked. “Yeah,” she said. Not angry, just sad. “I do.”</p><p>She laid her head back down on Helena’s chest, one arm curling over her waist. The silence stretched, tired.</p><p>Helena kept her eyes on the ceiling. She didn’t move.</p><p>The words were there, crouched just behind her teeth. Hot and sharp, waiting to be released. But she was afraid of what would happen if she set them loose. Afraid that once it had a name — spoken out loud between them, freely — the grief of losing it would become unbearable. A sorrow too complete to survive. </p><p>She wanted to say it. She wanted to say it more than anything in the world. But Helly had taken the leap first, and Helena was left holding the silence.</p><p>She ran her fingers through Helly’s hair — slow, thoughtless, tender. Holding her through the night, the only offering she had left. She wanted it to be enough — wanted <em> herself </em> to be enough. But Helly was all-consuming, and Helena was tired. Fractured. Too many pieces of herself scattered across a life she was barely hanging onto.</p><p>These little escapes were shrinking, thinning at the seams. </p><p>She wondered how much longer they’d be anything at all.</p><p>⟡</p><p>They tried.</p><p>After that first trip to New York, they really, honestly tried.</p><p>Helly came home for the holidays, but it felt strained. She was different. Worn thinner, edges sharper. The city had reshaped her bones. Their father watched her too closely. Helena couldn’t blame him. She watched, too. Couldn’t help it.</p><p>They stole time for themselves. They took long walks. They kissed in quiet corners and touched like they were running out of time. Because they always were.</p><p>Weekend trips to the city turned into overnights. Overnights turned into cancelled flights. Cancelled flights turned into missed calls and promises she couldn’t keep.</p><p>Helena found less and less time. Lumon was tightening around her like a noose — more meetings, more expectations, more carefully worded statements she didn’t remember agreeing to. Her inbox bled into her calendar. Her calendar bled into her life. Her father stopped asking how she was. Dropped the pretense. Just told her what came next.</p><p>Helly stopped asking, too. At first, she was understanding. She grew up with Helena. Knew what Father was. Knew what Lumon was. But the distance changed her, stealing her patience and replacing it with something less forgiving.</p><p>The wedge crept in quietly. A text read but not answered. A letter unopened on her desk.</p><p>They still loved each other. That never changed. But everything else did.</p><p>Their twenty-first birthday was just around the corner. Their two-year anniversary of becoming <em> something </em>almost as close. </p><p>Helena had a trip booked to New York. Three days. The longest they’d ever gotten.</p><p>Helly had been talking about it nonstop on the phone — giddy in a way Helena rarely got to hear anymore. Her voice had that bright, manic tilt it got when she was excited and trying not to show it.</p><p>“I planned everything,” she said, breathless. “Literally <em> everything. </em> I made an itinerary. A spreadsheet.”</p><p>Helena had laughed, genuinely. “You made a <em> spreadsheet</em>?”</p><p>“I did,” Helly said proudly. “Color-coded. Hour-by-hour. I even built in wiggle time. Because I know you get stressed when things go off-schedule.”</p><p>“You <em> hate </em>planning.”</p><p>“I do,” Helly admitted. “But you love it. So this is your present.”</p><p>Helena hadn’t known what to say to that. Just another confirmation of something she had already known. Helena’s love for Helly didn’t bloom — it seeped. Bled. Quiet and hidden, pressed between the cracks. Helly’s love for her was everything hers wasn’t — loud and soft all at once. Shameless, full-bodied, leaving no space untouched.</p><p>Helena could never match it. She couldn’t even try.</p><p>So she just said, “Thank you,” and let herself believe, for these few minutes, on the phone with the person who loved her more than anyone ever would, anyone ever <em> could </em>, that everything was going to be okay.</p><p>She knew it wouldn’t be. </p><p>What she hadn’t told Helly — what she couldn’t bring herself to say — was that Lumon was preparing to go live with a major product launch over their birthday weekend. A rollout their father had been orchestrating for weeks. Helena was still waiting on his approval to leave.</p><p>An approval she knew, somewhere deep in the hollow of her chest, wasn’t coming. She wanted to believe he might let her go. Might give her this one thing, the <em> only </em>thing she had ever really asked for in her full-time tenure. </p><p>But she already knew how this would end. She always did.</p><p>She hadn’t told Helly because part of her wanted to spare her the disappointment until she knew for certain. But a bigger part of her was deeply afraid. How many more moments could slip between the cracks before it all crumbled? She was holding onto Helly like water cupped in her hands — running down the coast, each wave crashing against her harder than the last, spilling more and more of what little she had left. </p><p>She wanted to scream. Or yell. Or cry. Something loud and visceral that would shake her out of herself. Reset her brain. Snap the fog in half. Something that would give her enough clarity to see the one impossible path out of a million that might get them through this. The one that would beat the odds. That would make the trip happen. That would stretch three days into a lifetime’s worth of borrowed time — full enough, sweet enough, to outrun the storm.</p><p>“Oh no.” Helly’s voice snapped her out of her fugue. Sharp. Cold. Already pulling away. “Helena.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>A pause.</p><p>“You’re not coming, are you?”</p><p>“What? Why would you say that?” Her heart slammed against her ribs. She hadn’t even said it. Hadn’t even hinted at it. And still — Helly knew. Of course she knew. </p><p>“I can just tell,” Helly sighed. She had never sounded more tired. “I can hear it in your voice. You’re not coming.”</p><p>She wasn’t angry at Helly for figuring it out. She was angry at herself. For giving it away. For not keeping the mask on perfectly. “Lumon is going live with—”</p><p>“I really, actually don’t give a fuck,” Helly cut her off, angry now. Voice rising. Bordering on yelling. “Genuinely could not give less of a shit about what Lumon is doing. What are <em> you </em>doing?”</p><p>“I—”</p><p>“Because if you’re not coming I’m hanging up.”</p><p>“Helly—”</p><p>“Okay. Bye.”</p><p>The call ended. The line went dead. Helena didn’t move.</p><p>Her phone was still in her hand, screen gone dark, the shape of it pressing into her palm like a bruise. She stared at nothing — not the desk, not the floor, not even the outline of her own reflection in the window. Nothing.</p><p>A terrible stillness settled in her gut. Heavy. Slow-spreading. The kind of feeling that didn’t move. It just sat there — awful and full and final. She knew it. She couldn’t name it or she would jump out of her fifth story window. But she knew it.</p><p>She sat with it for days. Helly wouldn’t answer her calls.</p><p>Then, finally, two days after their birthday, it happened. She got the letter.</p><p>
  <em> Helena, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I’m writing instead of calling because if I hear your voice I know I won’t be able to do this. </em>
</p><p><em> I’m ending this. Whatever we are. This isn’t just about the cancelled trip, so please don’t blame yourself. We both </em> <strike> <em> suspected </em> </strike> <em> knew we were living on borrowed time. I can’t keep pretending a few days a year is enough. It isn’t. We both know this is no way to live. </em></p><p><strike> <em> I’m sorry that </em> </strike> <em> I hate that our last conversation ended the way it did. I wish we both could have more closure. But there was never going to be a clean stopping point, was there? You were right the whole time. This was fucked up. It was beautiful and real and fucked up. We could never figure out how to balance it. </em></p><p><em> I have to be completely honest. I </em> <strike> <em> started </em> </strike> <em> met someone a few months ago. It’s not anything yet. But it could be. And I want to know what it feels like to be with someone who can love me full time. Someone who doesn’t have to apologize every time they leave. Someone who doesn’t have to promise that next time will be the time that feels like enough. </em></p><p>
  <em> I will never feel whole without you. But being with you in pieces is worse. I can’t keep being reminded of all the ways that I’m empty. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I will never have anything but unconditional love for you, my baby sister. And I will never be in love with someone as madly as I’m in love with you. But I can’t keep waiting for your love to be enough to make the rest of my life bearable. I need something I can hold, not just miss. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Please don’t write back. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I love you. I’m letting you go. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Helly </em>
</p><p>The pain was so sharp it felt dizzying. Like being split in two, trying to crawl her way back to herself. She had a meeting in ten minutes. She couldn’t miss it. She took a deep breath. </p><p>Was it really that unbearable to wait? So impossible to go a few months between visits? Of course, some visits would be cancelled. Some calls missed. Some letters unanswered. That’s just life. Busy, messy, imperfect. That didn’t mean they had to end it. To burn what little romance they could hold. To destroy everything that made being alive worth anything at all.</p><p>Another deep breath. A tear, catching and cutting through mascara. A clock striking five til ten.</p><p>She had sacrificed everything to protect Helly. To give her the life she could never claim for herself. To let her have a chance at holding something real. Now that Helly was actually doing it, she felt sick to her stomach. The nausea sat low and heavy beneath her ribs, expanding slow as ink in water. Staining everything.</p><p>She didn’t want Helly to move on. She wanted Helly all to herself. She felt selfish. Angry at Helly for being selfish. Angry at herself for being angry. </p><p>A second tear. A third. A tissue, catching them. A final deep breath. </p><p>A walk to the board room.</p>

  <p>“Hello?”</p><p>“Hey. It’s me. Sorry to call you so late.” Helena glanced at the time on her phone. 2:06 a.m.</p><p>“Is everything okay?” Helly’s voice was thick with sleep.</p><p>“Father passed.”</p><p>Silence. </p><p>Helena let her process. Let them both process. It was quiet for so long she checked the screen to make sure the call hadn’t dropped. “Are you still there?”</p><p>“Yeah. Sorry,” Helly muttered. Processing.</p><p>“I know you haven’t… I know you two weren’t speaking. Do you think you’ll come to the funeral?”</p><p>“Uh.” Another pause. Long enough to sting. “I don’t know, Helena. Can I call you back in the morning?”</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>“Bye.”</p><p>She hadn’t heard Helly’s voice in nearly a decade. Not since she stopped coming home for the holidays. Stopped returning messages. Cut out the family like a dying limb. Her voice sounded different now — raspier, maybe. From sleep, or age, or cigarettes, Helena didn’t know. There was so much she didn’t know anymore.</p><p>Time moved strangely after loss. It stretched and folded in on itself. Ten years didn’t feel like ten years, but somehow, that much time had passed between Helena and the only person who had ever made her feel fully human.</p><p>She had stayed at Lumon longer than she should have.</p><p>At first, it was fear. Cobel’s blackmail looming overhead, quiet and absolute. But even after it became clear that Cobel no longer cared enough to meddle, the fear didn’t leave. It calcified into something heavier. Duty. The kind bred into her. Thick in the blood, marrow-deep.</p><p>She told herself it was temporary. Just until the dust settled. Just until she figured out who she was without Helly. But time passed, and she didn’t leave. Not when the long nights turned into longer weeks. Not when the meetings stacked up like body blows. Not when the work stopped feeling like armor and started feeling like punishment.</p><p>She became a high-functioning alcoholic. For a while, at least. The high-functioning part didn’t last.</p><p>It all came apart slowly. A handful of missed deadlines. A voicemail from her father she didn’t return. An empty liquor bottle in her desk drawer, forgotten until someone else found it.</p><p>She left Lumon quietly, years later — no press release, no ceremony. Her father called. Said she was throwing her life away. Said she would regret it. Said she’d never be free of the family name, no matter how far she ran. She didn’t argue. Just sold her stock options and disappeared. </p><p>The looming force that had dictated her every move — so absolute it had once felt divine — vanished overnight. It hadn’t crumbled. Hadn’t been defeated. It had simply disappeared. All she had to do was stop believing in its power, and it was gone.</p><p>That truth was unbearable. Not freeing — not at first. Just sickening. Like waking from a lifelong nightmare and realizing she’d missed her real life entirely. That the fear was only ever fear. A mirage built to control her. A paper tiger she spent years bowing to like a god.</p><p>She couldn’t understand why it took her so long. Why she gave so much of herself to something that never even had claws. Its absence left behind a silence so vast it echoed. And in that silence — finally, quietly — came a beginning.</p><p>It sobered her in more ways than one.</p><p>For a while, she wandered. Tried to write. Tried to recover. She sent Helly letters — several in a row. Small things. Nothing dramatic. No begging, no grand declarations. Just: <em> I hope you’re okay. </em> Just: <em> I miss you. </em> Just: <em> Happy birthday. </em></p><p>Eventually, Helly wrote back. One short letter. One firm no.</p><p>She couldn’t understand why. </p><p>She didn’t send another.</p><p>Instead, she moved upstate. Bought a small storefront in a coastal town. Opened a flower shop with peeling paint and no signage. Most days, she liked the unhurried air of it all. She worked with her hands. She made things grow. People smiled at her when she handed them tulips wrapped in brown paper.</p><p>She tried to unflatten herself. She tried to let the light back in that she lost somewhere in childhood. She tried to reclaim the part of herself that she had given to Helly — that sharp, brilliant, untamable girl. </p><p>But she couldn’t quite reach her. That version of herself was gone. Sometimes she caught glimpses — a moment of stillness that didn’t feel like loneliness, a whirlwind affair with someone kind but temporary, a laugh that slipped out before she could think better of it. But mostly, she just got by.</p><p>She wondered if this was all there was left for her. No explosive highs, no crashing lows. Fractured pieces of her soul, still just out of reach. Scattered across time. Tucked somewhere hidden in her. Somewhere in New York. Maybe that was okay. It wasn’t glamorous. It wasn’t profound. But it was hers. For the first time in her life, something belonged to her. Fully, quietly, entirely hers.</p><p>She got the phone call at 1:38 a.m. from her second cousin. The only person in her family she had any contact with at all since she left Lumon. He told her that her father passed quietly in his sleep. That she and Helly were welcome to come to the funeral, despite everything. Helena thanked him. Said <em> maybe </em>. Ended the call.</p><p>She felt nothing.</p><p>That wasn’t entirely true. She felt something, but not for him. Not satisfaction that he passed — she had released his control over her long ago. Certainly not grief that he died. What she felt was hope. A door cracking open. A sliver of possibility.</p><p>She debated calling Helly at all. Took twenty minutes to convince herself to do it. Then spent the rest of the night second-guessing her decision.</p><p>She tried to sleep, but she was too afraid she’d miss the call — if it came. She turned her phone volume all the way up. Woke every twenty minutes to check the screen, just in case. She hoped, prayed, that Helly would call her back. That she would come to the funeral. That this finally might be the path back to the only person she’d never stopped loving.</p><p>⟡</p><p>The chapel in the estate was colder than she remembered. Somehow, even more lifeless and sterile. Nothing that evoked divinity. She wondered if that was the point. If it was all a test of loyalty, fear leaving no room for inspiration.</p><p>Helena sat near the front, hands folded in her lap, surrounded by people she didn’t recognize but who all seemed to know who she was. The Eagan name drew attention, even in death. Especially in death.</p><p>Her gaze drifted toward the door every few seconds. She didn’t mean to keep checking. But she couldn’t stop.</p><p>And then —</p><p>Helena didn’t have to turn around to know she was there. She felt it — the shift, the pull — their energies seeking each other like magnets. </p><p>Helly stepped in like a storm held at bay. Black dress. Wide-brimmed hat. Hair tied back like she was trying not to look like herself. </p><p>The rush hit her like a blow — starting deep and flooding outward, flushing her limbs with heat. Her skin prickled. Her heart slammed against her ribs. If this was what it felt like just seeing her from across a room, Helena was terrified to imagine what it would feel like to be with her again. </p><p>She fidgeted. Hesitated. Took a few deep breaths that didn’t seem to reach her lungs. Then she stood, walked the long, impossible distance to her estranged sister. </p><p>She felt naked under Helly’s gaze. Exposed in a way that made her bones ache. Like daring to stand there, daring to exist after being rejected so thoroughly, might grind her to dust. </p><p>Helly shifted her weight from foot to foot. Adjusted the strap of her bag. “Hey, stranger,” she said, finally. Voice low, brittle around the edges.</p><p>Helena swallowed. It took a second longer than it should have to find her voice. Then, as casually as she could muster, “Hey.”</p><p>Helly gave a short, humorless laugh. “Guess it took a funeral.”</p><p>“Guess it did,” Helena echoed.</p><p>For a second, it almost felt like the years collapsed. Like she could step forward, close the distance, say something silly and earnest and fix it all. </p><p>She didn’t move.</p><p>“You look good,” Helly said, glancing down and then away like she was doing something wrong by looking at all. Like she was being careful. So careful it was obvious. Contradictory.</p><p>“You do too,” Helena said, holding her gaze. She wanted Helly to see it. The way she had changed. The way she had grown stronger. </p><p>“Hey, I’m sorry about Father. I don’t know if you two were close—”</p><p>“We hadn’t spoken in years,” Helena cut her off.</p><p>“Were you— did you leave Lumon?” Helly asked, confused.</p><p>“Helly.” She tilted her head slightly. “I left years ago. You didn’t know?”</p><p>“I— no. You— nobody ever told me.”</p><p>“I tried to reach out.” The words stung in Helena’s throat. She didn’t want to bring this up. Not right away. She wanted to connect first. Pull her in before she could be pushed away. But it sat like bile, the nausea overwhelming. She couldn’t hold it down. “You made it pretty clear that you wanted nothing to do with me.” </p><p>“Look,” Helly took a deep breath. “Can we talk after the service?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Helena bit the inside of her cheek. <em> At least she still wanted to talk. </em></p><p>“I’ve really missed you.” Helly’s face softened, just a fraction, the admission peeling back something guarded. For the first time, Helena recognized her again. “I have a lot to apologize for.”</p><p>Helena inhaled sharply. There was something <em> off </em>about the way Helly said it. Something almost uncanny. Like Helena was a priest at confessional and Helly was preparing to atone for her sins. </p><p>The service began with platitudes neither of them believed. Helena and Helly sat side by side in the front row, hands clenched in their laps. The room was heavy with forced reverence. Every word from the officiant’s mouth sounded like it had been pulled from an obituary template. Helena stared ahead, half-listening, half-counting the seconds.</p><p>Helly leaned in, her voice barely a breath against her ear. "He’s still ruining our lives. Even dead."</p><p>Helena snorted — too loud. A hand clapped over her mouth a second too late. A few heads in the next pew snapped toward them with thinly veiled disgust.</p><p>Helly smiled innocently, the very picture of mourning decorum, while Helena pressed her knuckles to her lips and shook with the effort of not laughing harder.</p><p>Helly glanced over, amused. “It wasn’t <em> that </em>funny.”</p><p>Helena collected herself. “Shut up,” she whispered. “You’re gonna get me in trouble with his ghost.”</p><p>It was Helly’s turn to hold it together poorly. A smile crept up her face so wide that people were starting to stare. It wasn’t a good look — the only daughters of the man in the coffin laughing through his funeral. That made it even funnier. It all stacked. The absurdity, the guilt, the years of grief and rage they weren’t allowed to show — all piled on top of each other until they were nearly in tears from trying not to laugh.</p><p>And then the organ started.</p><p>The first few notes cracked the air like a whip. Helena flinched. It wasn’t a funeral hymn. It wasn’t for mourning. It was <em> the </em> hymn. The one they woke up to every morning. The one pumped through the estate like pesticide. The one stitched into the lining of their childhood like rot.</p><p>Her body reacted before her mind caught up. Her spine locked. Her hands curled into claws in her lap. Her breath thinned out into nothing.</p><p>Beside her, Helly jolted — sharp and immediate — like she’d been hit. Her leg bounced once, hard enough to make the whole pew rattle.</p><p>Helena stayed still. Shrinking inside herself. Teeth buried so deep in the inside of her cheek she tasted blood.</p><p>The music kept swelling. Commanding. Triumphant. A celebration of obedience.</p><p>A song for perfect daughters.</p><p>Helly’s fists clenched and unclenched. Her shoulders twitched like she might bolt. Helena did the opposite. Let the music pour over her like acid. If she stayed perfectly still it wouldn’t corrode. It was muscle memory. It was survival. It was a sickness they had never fully scraped out of themselves.</p><p>The hymn dragged on — an endless, nauseating loop — until finally, mercifully, it ended.</p><p>The silence that followed wasn’t relief. It was raw, exposed nerve. Helena flexed her fingers one by one, slowly, like thawing out after frostbite. Helly sat rigid beside her, fists still clenched on her thighs, but she was breathing again.</p><p>They didn’t need to say anything. A knowing, worn look passed between them.</p><p>The service stumbled through its final motions, but neither of them were really present anymore. They stood when everyone else did. They followed the slow crawl of people out the chapel doors, blinking against the weak daylight.</p><p>Outside, Helena caught Helly’s sleeve gently. “Hey,” she said. “Let’s get out of here. Off the estate. Grab a coffee or something.” She said it casually. Like she wasn’t desperate. </p><p>Helly hesitated — just a beat — then shook her head. “I’d rather we just go back to my hotel. Talk in private?” Her voice was quiet. Careful.</p><p>Helena nodded, heart hammering. “Yeah. Okay.”</p><p>They didn’t say much on the way to the hotel. Helena drove. Helly sat in the passenger seat, arms crossed loosely, staring out the window like she didn’t trust herself to look anywhere else. The estate disappeared in the rearview mirror. A sprawl of manicured nothingness shrinking into the horizon, but the weight of it stayed thick in the car, heavy and clawing.</p><p>Helena tightened her grip on the steering wheel. Every few seconds she caught herself glancing over, just to make sure Helly was real.</p><p>
  <em> She's here. She came back. She's breathing the same air as me again. </em>
</p><p>Helly fiddled with the hem of her jacket, restless in a way Helena hadn’t seen since they were kids — like she was ready to jump out of her skin if the car ride lasted a second longer.</p><p>The tension between them wasn’t awkward. It was volatile<em> . </em>Something waiting to ignite if either of them dared move too quickly.</p><p>When they pulled into the hotel parking lot, Helly was out of the car before Helena could even turn off the engine. She didn’t look back to check if Helena was following. She just walked toward the entrance — brisk, decisive — like she was afraid she might lose her nerve if she slowed down.</p><p>Helena locked the car and hurried after her, not knowing what to expect. The tension was different from when they were teenagers, discovering each other for the first time. There was a barrier now, and Helena couldn’t parse it.</p><p>They took the elevator up in silence. Helly stared at the floor numbers ticking higher. Helena stared at the back of Helly’s head, at the tightness in her shoulders, at the way she kept shifting her weight from foot to foot like she wanted to run.</p><p>Neither of them spoke.</p><p>The doors slid open with a sterile chime. Helly led the way down a bland, carpeted hallway. Swipe of the keycard. Click of the lock. She pushed the door open and walked in first.</p><p>Helly sat on the edge of the bed, perching stiffly like she wasn’t planning on staying long. She gestured vaguely to the chair across from her without meeting Helena’s eyes.</p><p>Helena pursed her lips together. Nodded once. Her heart dropped a little, heavy and slow, as she crossed the room and sat down.</p><p>This wasn’t going to be what she had half-dared to imagine. There wasn’t going to be some dizzy, magnetic crash back into each other’s arms. Helly didn’t ask her up here to fall apart together. She really, genuinely, just wanted to talk.</p><p>Helena folded her hands tightly in her lap. “Okay,” she said, almost under her breath. “I’m listening.”</p><p>Helly took a deep breath. Exhaled. Like she’d rehearsed this moment a thousand times but still couldn’t remember where to start. Helena waited, patient but wary. Finally, Helly said, “I’m really sorry for what I did to you.”</p><p>Helena nodded. “Okay.” It fell flat. It didn’t feel like much of anything. She still didn’t understand.</p><p>“I should have never—” she paused, shaking now. Took a deep breath. “When we were at school. I should have never started a sexual relationship with you. It was wrong. I’m sorry.”</p><p>She didn’t know what she expected, but it wasn’t that. The room turned into a vacuum. The air sucked out of her lungs. <em> What the fuck was she talking about? </em></p><p>“What the fuck are you talking about?”</p><p>The bluntness shook Helly. Her eyes snapped up to meet Helena’s. Her head tilted slightly, her brow furrowing. “Do you… not remember?”</p><p>Helena scoffed, confused. “Remember what? Our <em> sexual relationship</em>?”</p><p>“Yes…?” Helly responded, equally confused. “Did you… block it out?”</p><p>“I didn’t block anything out,” Helena responded, voice raising. Defensive. She felt angry now. Whatever Helly was trying to do felt like a sick joke. “So you regret it?”</p><p>“Of course I do,” Helly shook her head. “You don’t?”</p><p>“<em>No</em>,” Helena responded, viscerally. Shaking now, so aggressively that she was sure Helly would be able to see it. “What the fuck?” She asked again. If she asked hard enough, the past might crack open and give her a different answer. If she got angry enough — as angry as she should have been years ago — maybe time would split itself apart and stitch things the way they were supposed to be.</p><p>Helly looked like she was ready to bolt. Terrified to stay in this conversation. Scared in a way she hadn’t seen before. “Maybe you haven’t, yet, but I— I’ve had a lot of therapy, and—”</p><p>Helena laughed. Gutturally. Theatrically. There was cruelty underneath it, meant to mock and disarm. </p><p>"What the hell is your problem?" Helly snapped. She'd hit her limit. The edge where pretending to be enlightened stopped working. The carefully folded guilt tore open in her breath.</p><p>“Oh, you’re so <em> healed</em>. Look at you,” Helena leaned back, crossing her arms. “<em>Miss Therapy </em> had a few sessions and now she doesn’t want to fuck her twin sister.”</p><p>“Jesus, Helena.”</p><p>“You broke my fucking <em> heart</em>, Helly,” she yelled loud enough to echo through the room. “I gave up <em> everything </em> for you to have a normal life and I’m <em> glad </em> you had it, but don’t sit here and apologize for <em> abusing </em>me or whatever the fuck you’re implying.”</p><p>“I’m not—”</p><p>“Stop trying to sweep it under the rug.” Her voice cracked into a sob — ugly, raw. “What we had is the only thing that ever fucking mattered to me.” The words caught in her throat, ripped out unevenly. “If you moved on, <em> fine</em>. But don’t rewrite it just so you can check another trauma off your list and move on with your life.”</p><p>Helly was crying now, too, gently. Chin quivering. Controlled. “That’s not what I’m trying to do.”</p><p>“Then what the <em> fuck </em>are you trying to do?”</p><p>“I’m trying to give you closure.”</p><p>“You think I want <em> closure</em>?” Helena stood up, towering over Helly, speaking quieter now. Deeper. “I see exactly what you’re doing. You’re not healing anything. You’re pushing it down.”</p><p>Helly didn’t speak. Her chin quivered more aggressively.</p><p>“You think I can’t see through you?” Helena laughed. “I’m <em> you</em>, Helly.” Helly’s eyes went wide. She looked stricken, like Helena was cracking something open inside her she’d spent a decade sealing shut. “That’s how I know you want to fuck me right now. You still do. After all these years. And that really bothers you, doesn’t it? That you still want to fuck your sister, after all your <em> healing</em>.”</p><p>Helly stood up suddenly, inches from Helena’s face. “Fuck you,” she muttered, low and shaking. “Fuck you,” again, sharper, less held back. Her hands hit Helena’s shoulders, enough to shove her back a step. “<em>Fuck </em> you,” a third time, louder. </p><p>Real. </p><p>Cracked wide open.</p><p>Helena grabbed her face and kissed her like she was closing a wound.</p><p>Helly kissed her back like she was tearing open an old one.</p><p>Raw and breathless, all the years between them, folding in an instant. Desperate and wrong in the way that only the best things are.</p><p>Helena didn’t let up. She grabbed Helly’s wrist and dragged her backwards, half-guiding, half-shoving her toward the bed. Helly stumbled, breathless, as she fell back onto the mattress. Helena followed, crawling over her, mouths crashing together again, frantic and half-blind with it.</p><p>They fumbled with each other’s clothes, tugging and yanking, getting caught on buttons and zippers, not caring. Kissing through it, pulling apart only long enough to curse and breathe.</p><p>“I fucking hate you,” Helly gasped against her mouth, the words a live wire between them.</p><p>“I don’t care,” Helena growled, teeth scraping her bottom lip.</p><p>Helly’s hands slipped under Helena’s jacket, shoving it off her shoulders like she wanted to rip her apart just to get closer. Helena gripped the hem of Helly’s dress and dragged it upward, clumsy and rough, exposing skin she hadn’t touched in a decade and had never stopped dreaming about.</p><p>Helly bucked her hips up, forcing their bodies to collide harder, desperate to erase the distance, desperate to make Helena feel everything she’d buried.</p><p>“Say it again,” Helena dared her, panting against her jawline.</p><p>“I fucking hate you,” Helly repeated, nails digging into her hips like she meant it. But her mouth was already seeking Helena’s again. Hungry.</p><p>Helena shoved the dress the rest of the way up Helly’s body, stripping it off with a roughness that bordered on mean. Helly arched up into her, catching Helena’s mouth again, kissing her like she was furious about it.</p><p>Their underwear was still on. Thin, useless barriers. They rutted against each other, clumsy, too frantic for anything careful.</p><p>Helly dragged her mouth to Helena’s ear, breathing hard. “You think you're better than me.” Helena didn’t answer. Just kissed down her neck, biting, leaving little bruises like she could mark her way back inside her. </p><p>“You always have,” Helly gasped, grabbing at her hair. “You love holding it over my head— how much you gave up for me.”</p><p>Helena growled against her throat, heat flashing through her body.</p><p>“You think it makes you some kind of saint?” Helly pushed, her voice shaking with anger and something desperate. “It <em> ruins </em>it. If you’re always— always trying to cash in on it—”</p><p>Helena had heard enough. She shoved her hand between them, past the damp fabric, and pushed two fingers inside of her — rough, hard enough that Helly cried out, hands flying to Helena’s shoulders.</p><p>Helena curled her fingers viciously, finding the spot that made Helly jolt and sob and claw at her back. “You don’t get to rewrite history just because it hurts,” Helena rasped against her ear. “Take it. You owe me that much.”</p><p>Helly whimpered, legs falling open wider on instinct, body betraying every bitter word out of her mouth. She hated her for it. Loved her for it. She’d never stopped.</p><p>Helena fucked her harder, grinding her palm against her clit with every thrust, swallowing every broken sound she made.</p><p>“Say it,” Helena hissed, curling her fingers again. “Say you missed me.”</p><p>Helly choked on a moan. “I fucking hate you,” she managed, tears spilling over her cheeks.</p><p>Helena smiled grimly. Pressed harder. "Close enough."</p><p>Helly came hard, her whole body locking up — back arched, mouth open in a silent scream, thighs clamping around Helena's hand like she could trap her there. Helena didn’t stop. She slowed just enough to drag it out, to make Helly sob with how much more she could take if Helena demanded it.</p><p>Helly pushed weakly at her shoulder, a helpless, shoving motion that meant nothing. Helena grabbed her wrist and pinned it to the bed above her head. Helly’s breath hitched — not in fear, not in anger, but surrender. The kind only Helena had ever been able to rip out of her.</p><p>"You hate me?" Helena whispered against her ear, biting the shell of it. "Prove it."</p><p>Helly writhed beneath her, half-crazed, still trembling from the aftershocks. She twisted her free hand into Helena’s hair and yanked her mouth down — kissed her so hard their teeth clicked. Sloppy. Uncoordinated. Starving.</p><p>Helena pulled back, lips slick and swollen, just far enough to see the wrecked look on Helly’s face. "You don't hate me," she said, almost tenderly. "You hate yourself."</p><p>Helly let out a broken, choked sound.</p><p>"You hate that you still want this," Helena whispered. "You hate that no matter how far you run, how much therapy you buy, it still lives in you."</p><p>Helly squeezed her eyes shut like she could block it out. Like she could will Helena into silence.</p><p>Helena kissed her eyelids. Her nose. Her jaw. Her throat. All soft now, devastatingly soft, the cruelty shifting into something worse. Something holy. Devotion. Worship. Like Helly could still be saved.</p><p>"You’re not broken because of me," Helena whispered into the hollow of her throat. "You’re broken because you’re mine."</p><p>Helly sobbed again, body shuddering under her. She grabbed Helena’s face with both hands and kissed her like it was the last thing she'd ever get to do right.</p><p>Helena let herself be kissed. Let Helly’s tears mix with her own and stain them both. Corrupting. Purifying. Ruin and salvation all at once.</p><p>When Helly pulled back, gasping, Helena reached between them and dragged her panties down her thighs — slow, deliberate. She cupped her, still so slick and trembling.</p><p>"Again," Helena said.</p><p>Helly nodded, desperate, reckless. "Again."</p><p>Helena pushed into her, slower this time — deeper — and Helly opened her mouth in a wordless cry.</p><p>"Tell me you missed me," Helena said, low and deadly against her neck.</p><p>"I missed you," Helly gasped.</p><p>"Tell me you never stopped wanting me."</p><p>"I never stopped," Helly cried. "I never fucking stopped."</p><p>Helena curled her fingers again, and Helly shattered. This time, truly shattered — split open, emptied out, gathered up by the same hands she herself had once pulled from the fire. Helena, hallowed by deliverance, carried Helly home — transfigured, like an answered prayer — until the distance between them burned away and left only devotion.</p><p>They stayed wrapped around each other, grieving the years of empty space. The echoes still pulsed between them, raw and fragile. </p><p>It took a long time for Helly to stop shaking. Longer for her to catch her breath. She buried her face in Helena’s neck, wet with sweat and tears and something worse, something older. Helena stroked her hair silently, fingers trembling now too.</p><p>"I'm sorry," Helly whispered, voice so wrecked it barely existed. "I'm sorry. I'm sorry."</p><p>Helena kissed the side of her head. "I know," she whispered back. "I know."</p><p>Helena eased them up the bed until they were lying down properly — Helly tucked into her chest, Helena’s arms around her like she could shield her from everything that ever went wrong between them. Helly was quiet now, except for the occasional hitch of her breath.</p><p>"You ruined me," Helly said finally, muffled against her skin.</p><p>"You ruined me first," Helena said.</p><p>Neither of them apologized.</p><p>Helena pulled the blanket over them without thinking. Like this was just another night they could fall asleep like this — naked, wrecked, tangled. Breathing the same air.</p><p>She pressed her lips to Helly’s forehead, soft, reverent. "You’re the only thing that ever felt real," she whispered.</p><p>Helly didn’t answer, but Helena felt the way she held on tighter — like if she let go, they’d lose each other all over again.</p><p>Maybe they would anyway.</p><p>Maybe they were two halves of a fractured soul, still reaching for each other in the dark — always circling, never quite landing.</p><p>Maybe that was enough.</p><p>For now, it was.</p>

    <p>Chapter End Notes</p>
    <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Thank you to everyone who stuck around until the end &lt;3 I did not expect to pour such a large piece of my soul into what was originally supposed to be a pwp oneshot, but these two wouldn't let me go. I hope I did their love story justice. This is my favorite thing I've ever made. I would love a comment if you made it this far, and if you have any questions I'd love to answer.</p><p>I really wanted to capture the cyclical nature of their relationship — their yin and yang, endlessly inverting and reflecting each other. They were born from the same soul and shared the same fire, but Helena’s protectiveness of Helly caused her to bear the punishments, and slowly, inevitably, her flame dimmed. Helly reignited it by starting their romance, but left before Helena could fully realize it. The spark survived, barely, and in the decade apart, Helena fanned it into a blaze.</p><p>Meanwhile, Helly lived a very different ten years. Through Helena’s sacrifice, she was granted a normal life. But without the academy/Lumon to rebel against — and without Helena to steady her — she lost a target at which to direct her inner turmoil. The chaos turned inward. In desperation, she sought a framework to contain it. Her therapist reframed their love as pathology: two sisters, close in age, bonded by trauma, tangled emotionally and physically. The erasure of the only real love Helly had ever known flattened her, just as trauma had once flattened Helena.</p><p>By the time the funeral comes, Helly speaks the language of healing but carries none of its peace. Helena sees right through her, and finally has the courage to do something about it. In minutes, she undoes years of repression with one holy truth: their love is real. Helena fulfills her destiny. She brings Helly back home. In doing so, she dooms them to repeat the cycle, but she also sanctifies it. She saves them both through divine, ruinous love.</p><p>One last thing — this song reminds me of them <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bACMIB_VhlE" rel="nofollow">(Banana Bread - Cavetown)</a></p></blockquote>
