<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Helly heaves the trash bag over her shoulder and into the overflowing dumpster. It bounces back, crashes to the pavement, and explodes. She throws her hands up, whispers a half-hearted <em> fuck </em> under her breath, then goes back inside. It doesn't really matter. She's being evicted tomorrow anyway. Let the landlord deal with it. He couldn't give her a few more days to get her rent together, he can enjoy picking up rotting takeout and a half-chewed protein bar she spit out—right next to a waterlogged <em> Forbes </em>cover with Helena Eagan's insufferably smug face still somehow untouched. </p><p>Not that he'd clean any of it up anyway. Since Helly moved in, getting him to make the place even halfway livable was like pulling teeth. She figures she'll be better off on the streets. Same number of rats, no monthly payment.</p><p>The only solace she finds in her current, even-worse-than-usual streak of bad luck is the fact that she shares a face with her sister. Maybe some passerby will think it's the great Helena Eagan curled up in the back of a '97 Volvo, or shoplifting day-old bread from the gas station, or washing her hair in a public restroom sink. The thought makes her smile for the first time in days.</p><p>She trudges back inside and takes stock of what's left, then decides to leave most of it behind. She's had to do this several times in her thirty-five years—more often lately. Dirt broke doesn't even begin to describe it. It's more like six feet under and owing rent on the grave. That's nothing new. What <em> is </em>new is that, for the first time in her life, she's completely, utterly alone.</p><p>But she doesn't have time to dwell on the breakup or how her ex got full custody of all their friends. She needs a plan. Something she's never been good at making and even worse at sticking to, but what else can she do? Floating through life has only carried her from one disaster to another. It's time to lock in. Do it the right way. Get a shitty, soul-sucking job that pays her bills and makes her want to blow her brains out. </p><p>Speaking of—she <em> could </em> just kill herself. That's always an option rattling around in the static between her neurons, too familiar to feel urgent. It had lingered so long it stopped feeling like a real possibility and started feeling more like background noise. She stops and thinks about it now, properly, for the first time in years. Now would be the time. No one would mourn her. Barely anyone would notice. She could end her pain cleanly, quietly, without causing a ripple. Seems like a no-brainer.</p><p>She sighs.</p><p>If only it were that easy. She doesn't have the stomach her sister had—twice—to go for it. And Helena <em> really </em>went for it. The first time, she'd swallowed an entire bottle of pills in some unused room at the estate and very nearly vanished without a sound. But Helly found her. Of course she did. Pure instinct. She knew something was wrong—felt it in her bones—and found Helena foaming at the mouth, barely breathing. She called the ambulance just in time.</p><p>The second time was even more dramatic, desperate, impulsive. Helly had seen Helena from her bedroom window, out past the expanse of manicured lawn, tying a noose to one of the pool house rafters. Everyone was supposed to be gone that day, but Helly had woken up with a sore stomach and never mentioned she was staying home. </p><p>She bolted across the yard, yelling <em> HEY, WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING </em> with everything she had in her lungs. She was sure Helena heard her—too far to see her face, but close enough to see the way her hands moved faster, more frantic. She was really going to do it. She was going to kill herself in front of her like it was nothing. By the time Helly made it there, Helena had already kicked the stool away, and, unfortunately for Helena, it didn't snap her neck. Helly caught her just enough to keep her breathing, held her up while screaming for the neighbor until help finally came. Helena lived. Barely.</p><p>Just another failure Helena was rewarded for, while Helly didn't get so much as a thank you for saving her sister's life. <em> Her </em> reward for keeping Helena alive long enough to become the heir? Getting cut out of the family less than two months later. She wasn't needed anymore, and she'd always been too much of a problem to keep around.</p><p>She wonders how different, how unimaginably opulent her life would be if she'd never gone into that room, never looked out that window, never forced the crown onto Helena instead of herself. She almost feels guilty for having the thought—until she sees the pile of her stuff she'll have to leave behind forever, again, while Helena gets everything she's ever dreamed of and more.</p><p>Whatever. Worst breakup of her life and <em> still </em> all she can think about is her insufferable goddamn sister who hasn't even spoken to her in a decade and a half. </p><p>She may not be able to kill herself now, but she can certainly chip away at her life faster. She cracks open a bottle of vodka and drinks until she passes out.</p><p> </p><p align="center">─•~❉᯽❉~•─</p><p> </p><p>She's still wasted when the call comes in and wakes her up. Kier area code. Nothing good can possibly come from this. She hits ignore and shuts her eyes.</p><p>It rings again.</p><p>She checks the time and sees 4:08am. She realizes someone must have died. Not that it matters. Anyone from that town—anyone in her family—could drop dead and she wouldn't shed a tear. Still, curiosity wins out. She answers.</p><p>"What?" she asks, somehow slurring a single word. </p><p>There's a pause on the other end. "Hi, Helly."</p><p>Helena. She hadn't heard her voice—directed at her, anyway—in fifteen years. But she recognized it instantly. She hears her on the news every so often. Even if she didn't, she'd never forget it. Even if she <em> could</em>, it's basically her own voice. Hard to miss. The sheer suffocating presence of her—how deeply she's wired into Helly's system—starts to choke her. She hates how even after all this time, Helena still has her by the neck.</p><p>"Who died?" Helly asks, not particularly interested in spending more time on the phone with her sister than absolutely necessary.</p><p>Another pause. "Father."</p><p>Helly laughs. Can't help it. She doesn't bother pulling the phone away, or muting, or thinking about how Helena might take it. The man who single-handedly ruined any shot she had at a decent life is finally dead, and nothing can stop her from enjoying the moment she's dreamed of for years.</p><p>"How?"</p><p>"Uh," Helena pauses, clearly taken aback. "In his sleep. He went peacefully."</p><p>"That sucks," Helly sneers. "The peaceful part, I mean. Obviously."</p><p>She might be imagining it, but she swears she hears Helena huff a quiet breath of amusement through her nose. Maybe it's just static.</p><p>"I just want to let you know you're welcome to come to the funeral," Helena says softly. "You don't have to, of course. I just… want you there."</p><p>"Oh, fuck you," Helly scoffs. "I couldn't care less about what you want and I'm not gonna pretend to mourn the biggest piece of shit to ever live. Bye."</p><p>"Wait—" Helena blurts, just before Helly can hang up.</p><p>"What?" Helly groans.</p><p>"Don't come to the funeral, then. It's fine. I just…" There's another pause. Helly's finger hovers over the end call button, her impatience turning from a simmer to a boil. "I was hoping we could reconnect. Now that he's gone."</p><p>Helly's heart beats fast in her chest. <em> Hell no </em> is her first reaction. Helena had plenty of time over the years to reach out, to rekindle whatever they had when they were kids. But she didn't. Not one time. Not when Helly had to drop out of college because she couldn't afford it. Not when the tabloids unfairly dragged her through the mud. Not when she spent months couch surfing because nobody wanted to hire the disgraced Eagan twin. </p><p>And now—<em> now </em>—fifteen years later, at four in the fucking morning, Helena wants to reconnect. The audacity is so obscene Helly almost laughs in her face.</p><p>But she doesn't.</p><p>Instead, she says, "fine," without really understanding why.</p><p> </p><p align="center">─•~❉᯽❉~•─</p><p> </p><p>She hasn't been to Pip's since she was ten, but nothing's changed. Same laminated menus, same peeling leather booths, same smell of fry oil clinging to the air. She remembers sitting in this same corner booth across from Helena and their nanny at the time—Lisa, she thinks—who used to sneak them here every Thursday after school, always behind their father's back. It was their shared secret, the smallest of rebellions, wrapped in paper napkins and ketchup packets.</p><p>She flips open the menu and sees her favorite order still there: the kid's chicken tender meal with a free scoop of ice cream. Helena's order is still listed too, though she rarely touched it, even then. Just picked at the fries and pushed the rest around with her fork. Helly had barely noticed at the time, but seeing Helena's hollowed frame plastered all over town—on charity gala flyers, local magazines, even the side of a fucking bus—it's impossible not to recognize it for what it was: the early shape of a sickness no one cared enough to name.</p><p>That same hollowed frame now slips through the creaky door, eyes landing on the corner booth instantly. The moment stills. Helly's nervous system kicks awake all at once, responding to Helena like proof of life. She doesn't even realize her blood had turned to sludge until it starts moving again.</p><p>Helena smiles as she walks over—that practiced corporate thing, but she can't quite sell it. Not to Helly. It flickers at the edges like she knows it's pointless but feels obligated to try anyway. Helly doesn't bother with formalities, just leans back in the booth and waits. She revels in it; letting Helena come crawling back on her own time.</p><p>Helena reaches the table and hovers, like the seat might snap shut around her. "I didn't think you'd actually come."</p><p>"You think I'm that much of an asshole?"</p><p>"Kinda."</p><p>Helly laughs despite herself. Oh god, it already feels easy. She hates that. It shouldn't feel easy.</p><p>Helena finally sits down across from her. "You look really good, Helly. Seriously. You look healthy."</p><p>Still condescending as ever. "You look like shit," Helly responds in a half-joking tone, careful to leave the edge in.</p><p>Helena clears her throat. "I know you're probably wondering about Father's will."</p><p>"Not at all. I know he didn't leave me anything."</p><p>"Yeah, you're right. He didn't."</p><p>An awkward pause.</p><p>"Okay, thanks for bringing it up then," Helly laughs bitterly. Amazing how someone can run one of the largest companies in the world and still be this socially inept.</p><p>"Well—hold on. It doesn't seem right to me. I'm in talks with my lawyer to make sure you get your fair share," Helena says.</p><p>Helly scoffs. "So you can hang it over my head forever? No thanks. I don't need it. I'm actually doing just fine," she says, raising her voice. "You'd know that if you ever bothered calling."</p><p>"I know—I'm sorry. I didn't mean to imply—"</p><p>"Well you did," Helly cuts her off. "Is that all you wanted me to drive out here for? To treat me like a charity case? Clear your conscience over screwing me our whole lives with a cute little settlement?"</p><p>"Wow," Helena whispers, scrunching her face. "I didn't realize you were still so angry."</p><p>"What? I'm not," Helly responds, crossing her arms. She forgot that in Helena's world, anything above corpse-temperature counts as hostile.</p><p>"Okay. Right," Helena says quietly, tapping her fingers on the table a few times, glancing over at the tables now staring at them. "Maybe this was a mistake, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you to come."</p><p>"Jesus—are you fucking serious?" Helly can't believe what she's hearing. "You made me drive all the way out here just to insult me and leave?"</p><p>Helena coughs out a laugh. "You haven't changed a bit, Helly." She starts to gather her things. "Take care of yourself."</p><p>Helly's jaw locks as she watches her get up, a flush creeping up her neck like blood to an open wound. By the time Helly realizes she's not bluffing, she's already halfway across the diner.</p><p>"Fuck you, Helena," she shouts. "At least pay for my fucking gas."</p><p>Helena doesn't turn around. She just walks out the door.</p><p> </p><p align="center">─•~❉᯽❉~•─</p><p> </p><p>She doesn't know why she's here. She should have let it go—let Helena walk out of that restaurant and out of her life for good. But for whatever reason, something entirely outside her control, she can't. Helena wormed her way back in like a toxin, and Helly can't flush her out without bleeding herself dry.</p><p>Helly hovers over his open casket and smiles. It's good to see Father fully, finally lifeless—not just the half-alive shell she remembers, all body and no soul. The same body that broke her down, piece by piece, until there was nothing left to strip away. Now he's nothing. Just a bad memory. The echo of a death rattle. A reserved seat in hell.</p><p>"Helly?"</p><p>Of course. Even her smallest victory is cut short by his favorite weapon.</p><p>"Here I am." Helly whips around to meet her sister's gaze, presenting herself like a gift instead of a grenade with a loose pin.</p><p>"I didn't think you were coming," Helena flashes a strained smile, worry barely concealed. "I'm, uh. I'm glad you're here."</p><p>Helly laughs. "No you're not."</p><p>Helena takes a deep breath. "Why? Why are you here?"</p><p>"Relax," Helly says, stepping closer. "I'm not here to cause trouble. I promise. I just wanted to make sure he's actually dead."</p><p>Not entirely a lie. She had a nightmare last night—he came back just to wrap his hands around her throat one last time. She woke up gasping and slammed her forehead against the low ceiling of her Volvo. The bruise is still there, half-hidden under foundation. She doesn't realize how poorly it's covered until she catches Helena staring right at it.</p><p>"You should see the other guy," Helly quips.</p><p>"You got in a fight?"</p><p>"No," Helly huffs. "It's a joke. Sorry, I forgot you hate those."</p><p>Helena looks so bone-achingly exhausted that Helly actually feels bad.</p><p>Helly bites her lip and collects herself, the words feeling like sandpaper in her throat. "Listen," she starts. "I'm sorry I scared you off at Pip's."</p><p>Helena looks surprised. "It's okay. I'm sorry I made you drive out here just to leave so soon."</p><p>"Yeah, that sucked," Helly softens her tone. "I'm actually just here to collect my gas money."</p><p>A real smile flashes across Helena's face—first one since she got into town. "I fucking miss you, Helly."</p><p>The statement hits her sideways. She doesn't know how to digest it. It bounces around in her stomach, shredding the lining. Everything she could say back would come out primal and raw, half-digested truth mixed with bile. So she just nods. She fucking misses her, too.</p><p>"Hey, let's get a drink. That should help, right?" Helena suggests.</p><p>What she really means is there's no chance they can survive five sober minutes in the same room without one of them trying to kill the other. But Helena's always been better at wrapping ugly truths in palatable words. Helly never had the tact for it.</p><p>Helly heads straight for the bar. "Double shot of whiskey, please." She pauses, savoring the thought that it's on the Eagans' dime. "Actually, make it a triple."</p><p>"Sorry, ma'am, we only serve non-alcoholic beverages and wine."</p><p>Helly groans. "Fine. Red. And fill it all the way up."</p><p>The bartender glances at Helena.</p><p>"White is fine," Helena says quietly, offering a nod of thanks. "Just the normal pour."</p><p>Helly rolls her eyes, snatches her nearly overflowing glass, and stalks off toward the sitting area. She lands with a thunk in an oversized chair and starts chugging. Helena sits across from her, folding herself neatly, as if she's looking for a way to make herself smaller. Less threatening.</p><p>She fucking hates when Helena does that. Like Helly's a predator she has to shrink from. It brings her right back to their teens, when Helena started flinching away instead of reaching out. The sting burns as bad now as it did then—maybe worse, after all these years left to rot.</p><p>She tries to swallow it down with her wine. She really doesn't want a fight. She doesn't know what dragged her here, but she's certain it wasn't to ruin the last thin chance at mending what's left between them.</p><p>"So," Helly starts, edges already dulling from the alcohol burning her throat. "What's new?"</p><p>Helena laughs and it catches her off guard. She can't remember Helena laughing one time during their last few years at the estate together, but there's something different about her now. Not quite the ice queen she's built up in her head. </p><p>"Um, a few things," Helena says. "Just got promoted to head of the company a few days ago, for starters."</p><p>"Oh, cool. You have to kill a guy for that position?"</p><p>"Yeah, but don't tell anyone."</p><p>Now Helly's laughing too, head going fuzzy and light. </p><p>"What about you?" Helena asks, sipping her wine, studying Helly over the rim. "What's your life like these days?"</p><p>"Nothing crazy." Helly swirls her own glass. "Apartment in the city, girlfriend. Normal stuff." Would've been true a month ago. Close enough. Helena just happened to catch her down on her luck. She's not about to serve up her actual disaster of a life for her pampered sister to pity.</p><p>"A girlfriend?" Helena's eyebrow lifts. "That's great, Helly. I always suspected."</p><p>And just what the fuck is that supposed to mean? Even with the wine working through her system, Helena's condescending tone still hits like a slap. She can't help but bite back.</p><p>"Yeah, thanks. And I always suspected you'd turn out to be a bit of a whore. Have you?"</p><p>Helena's face drops. "What?"</p><p>Helly shrugs. "You've always been desperate for daddy's approval. I'm assuming you take it out on any dick you can get your hands on?"</p><p>"Christ, Helly," Helena sets her glass down and rubs the bridge of her nose. She looks like she's wracking her brain for something but can't quite find it. She settles on, "why?"</p><p>Helly sighs. "Sorry. <em> Sorry</em>. I swear I didn't come here to pick a fight."</p><p>"Could've fooled me," Helena mutters, picking up her glass and draining it in one go before waving it at the server. "We're gonna need a few more of these."</p><p>Time starts to blur. Helly's already hammered by the bottom of her first glass and keeps outpacing Helena at least three to one. She thinks the alcohol might unleash years of resentment in one violent slurry, but the opposite happens—she softens, loosens up, finds herself in actual rapport with the person she thought incapable of it.</p><p>They catch up on fifteen years of wreckage.</p><p>"My last boyfriend was a coke addict," Helena says, swirling her wine. "Found him passed out in my bathroom with a nosebleed. On my birthday."</p><p>"Sounds about right. You ever try girls?"</p><p>Helena laughs, and Helly finds herself enjoying the sound a bit too much. She's already filing away what works, chasing the next hit.</p><p>They pivot to Helly's employment disasters.</p><p>"—and then my manager fired me because I wouldn't fuck him."</p><p>"Jesus. Please tell me you sued."</p><p>"With what lawyer?" Helly picks at her nails. "Plus, he owns the bar. And the one down the street. And probably the labor board too."</p><p>Helena goes quiet at that, like she's just now realizing how different their worlds are.</p><p>By the time Helena starts talking about Lumon, Helly's vision is swimming. She can't track the words anymore, just watches Helena's mouth move. The sharp edges of her face turn soft through the wine haze. She looks so much like Helly, yet nothing like her at the same time. All that Eagan breeding polished to a shine instead of left to tarnish. Underneath the resentment, something else twists in her gut. Something strange hooking into her that she can't identify. Or maybe she just doesn't dare to name it.</p><p>"—and somehow, nobody got fired. Still don't know how I pulled that off."</p><p>"Thrilling." Helly nods like she's been listening. "Real edge-of-your-seat stuff."</p><p>Helena offers a strained smile, dipping her head. "Sorry, I've talked your ear off."</p><p>"No," Helly shakes her head. "It's good. This has been really good, strangely. I wasn't expecting it."</p><p>Helena lets out a visible breath. Pauses. "Would you ever think about moving back to Kier?"</p><p>Helly's laugh rips out of her, startling the people nearby. "Helena, are you fucking crazy? You couldn't get me back here with a gun to my head. I'd pull the trigger for you."</p><p>"No, I know," Helena shrinks again. "I knew you'd say that. I just had to ask."</p><p>"You miss me that bad, huh?"</p><p>"Well, yeah," Helena admits. "I just think—maybe we can put everything behind us and have a relationship now. As adults. It's important to have family." She glances toward the closed door where their father waits in his casket. "You know. <em> Real </em>family."</p><p>"I wouldn't know, actually." Helly works her jaw. "Considering my family threw me to the wolves."</p><p>Helena sets her glass down. "No, yeah, I totally get it. I'm sorry for that, by the way."</p><p>She's sorry. How touching. Helly's too drunk to bite back with anything sharp. Too exhausted to try to make Helena feel bad. Maybe she just doesn't want to anymore. At least not right now, not after the first good night they've had since they were teenagers. </p><p>"Whatever," she settles on. "I'm gonna head out."</p><p>"You're not staying for the service?"</p><p>Helly shoots her a look that says <em> you can't be serious</em>, and Helena nods.</p><p>"Right. Well, at least let my driver give you a lift home? You shouldn't drive like this," Helena says.</p><p>Helly doesn't know how to tell her that home <em> is </em>her car. She doesn't want to either. "I'm just gonna get a cab."</p><p>"You sure?"</p><p>"Positive."</p><p>Helena presses her lips together, then closes the distance and pulls Helly into a tight hug. Helly goes rigid. She can feel Helena's bones through her expensive dress, hard against her own soft skin. Her sister smells like wine and funeral flowers and something underneath that Helly recognizes from childhood—that shared scent they could never wash off. Helena holds on like she's trying to fuse them back into one person, and maybe that's what terrifies Helly. How easy it would be to let her. But she doesn't. Can't. Her body stays locked, counting the seconds until Helena lets go.</p><p>Helena pulls back. Something flickers across her face—there and gone before she can smooth it away.</p><p>"Okay." She straightens her dress, already rebuilding her mask for the crowd. "Be safe."</p><p> </p><p align="center">─•~❉᯽❉~•─</p><p> </p><p>She jolts awake from a knock on the window and hits her forehead in the same goddamn spot. It hurts worse the second time.</p><p>"Ow, <em> fuck</em>," she mutters to herself, head pounding from more than just the impact. She rolls down her window to be met with a more elegant version of her own face. "What?"</p><p>"What do you mean <em> what</em>?" Helena sneers. "I thought you were getting a cab."</p><p>"I was. I <em> am</em>," Helly rubs her head. "Why are you snooping by my car?"</p><p>Helena peers inside the open window. "Why do you have so much stuff in here?"</p><p>"God, you are so <em> fucking </em>annoying," she meets her sister's doe-eyed gaze. Pauses for a beat. "Fine. I'm living out of my car. Happy?"</p><p>Helena's mouth softens, eyes going distant for a moment. "No, of course not. Why would that—how long has this been going on?"</p><p>"Just a few days," Helly sinks down further into the reclined seat. "It's no big deal. I'll be back on my feet soon. This just happens sometimes."</p><p>"It's happened before?"</p><p>Now, more than ever, she wishes she had her sister's guts to pull the fucking trigger. </p><p>"Look," Helly starts, meeting her gaze. "I don't need your pity or your money or whatever else you're about to offer."</p><p>Helena scoffs. "How about a warm bed for the night?"</p><p>"Did you miss the part where I said—"</p><p>"Helly," she cuts her off. "Please. You can go back to living like this tomorrow if you really want to. Just—for god's sake, don't sleep in the parking lot of your father's funeral."</p><p> </p><p align="center">─•~❉᯽❉~•─</p><p> </p><p>If someone would have told her a few days ago that she'd be back at the estate, the one place on earth she'd rather die than step foot in again, she would've laughed in their face. But here she is. Back at the estate. </p><p>With her insufferable goddamn sister.</p><p>"Let me get you something to change into," Helena calls from her closet.</p><p>"You <em> really </em>think we're the same size? Or are you just trying to make me feel fat?" Helly retorts.</p><p>Helena pokes her head out and frowns. "We're similar enough. You'll fit into my clothes." She tosses Helly a shirt.</p><p>Helly strips off her dress. Then her bra. She looks up to find Helena staring, then looking away the second their eyes meet. It's a little awkward, but easy enough to brush off. So she does.</p><p>She squeezes the shirt over her head. Tight around the arms, but manageable.</p><p>"Told you," Helena shrugs.</p><p>"This must be huge on you."</p><p>"It's a little big on me. Who cares?" Helena's expression flickers—annoyed, maybe. Like Helly's crossed some invisible line just by acknowledging it out loud. "You want pants?"</p><p>"No, it's fine. I'll just sleep in my underwear."</p><p>"You always did run hot at night."</p><p>A strange chill moves through her. Not fear exactly, but something quieter. Off-kilter. The words hang a second too long. She hadn't expected Helena to remember things like that. She isn't sure if she's reading too much into it or if there's something strange floating between them. The idea that there might be is enough to make her skin prickle. She suddenly feels exposed. Suddenly realizes she's in Helena's house now.</p><p>"I'll take the pants, actually," she corrects.</p><p>"Okay," Helena shrugs, throwing a pair at her. </p><p>Helly tries to slide them on but she can't get them over her hips. Whatever. She's being silly. She tosses them back.</p><p>"So, where am I sleeping?"</p><p>"You don't wanna sleep in our childhood room?" Helena quips.</p><p>"Mm, I'm about to go back out to my car."</p><p>"The guest room down the hall is all set up," Helena says, and something about the way she trails off feels unfinished. Like there was another sentence behind it she chose not to say.</p><p>"Okay," Helly laughs. "Am I crazy? Like, am I just losing it being back here? Or are you acting super weird?"</p><p>Helena furrows her brow. "What do you mean?"</p><p>Helly shakes her head. Now she feels crazy for saying anything. "Never mind."</p><p>"No, say it," Helena crosses her arms. "Weird how?"</p><p>Christ. She certainly is <em> not </em>going to say it. She doesn't even want to think it. In fact, she's never thought it. That would be insane. She's just half-drunk and back in her weird childhood home and she's going through a lot right now. Whatever.</p><p>"I think I need to go throw up," she says, turning around and heading for the bathroom.</p><p>"Seriously?" Helena's face drops. "Or are you joking?"</p><p>"No, I—ugh. I drank way too much. Sorry. Plug your ears. I'm a loud puker."</p><p>She slams the door and collapses in front of the toilet, grateful to at least be screaming into marble rather than pavement. She hears it echo throughout the entire estate. She's humiliating herself—she knows it—but she can't make herself care any less about Helena seeing her this way. She hates that she cares at all.</p><p>She rinses her mouth out in the sink and opens the door to Helena standing directly in front of it, toothbrush and toothpaste in hand. She jumps. "Jesus—fuck. Were you there the whole time?"</p><p>"Here," she hands the items to Helly. "Should I have some tea sent up for you?"</p><p>"No, I'm fine," she shakes her head. "I probably just need to take a shot. Do you have any whiskey?"</p><p>Helena shakes her head. "You're thirty-five years old, Helly."</p><p>Helly glares at her sister and turns her back, scrubbing at her teeth. It was like this their entire teens—Helena hovering, pretending to help, always ready to judge. Always needing to feel above her. She wonders if she ever gets off on it. If she ever lies awake at night and slips her hand down her pants, rubs her clit to the thought of how much better she turned out. The image hits so viscerally that Helly has to blink it away.</p><p>"Everything alright?"</p><p>There she is—still. Watching, as if Helly might cheat her way through brushing, like a child. Like she can't be trusted unless Helena sees the whole thing through.</p><p>Helly spits and wipes her mouth, then pushes past Helena with an intentional shoulder check.</p><p>"Wait." Helena catches her wrist, grip tight.</p><p>Helly turns, startled by the contact. "What?"</p><p>"You're not feeling well. Stay in my room tonight."</p><p>Helly stares at her, thrown by the request. "Uh. No?" She tries to pull her wrist free, but Helena's fingers only tighten.</p><p>"Just—look. I know I've let you down. A lot."</p><p>Of course. Here it comes. Helly should've seen it: the forced reckoning, Helena needing to bleed out her guilt into Helly's hands, hoping that one honest admission might make up for a lifetime of inaction. She finally has Helly cornered and she isn't going to let the opportunity go to waste.</p><p>"Holy shit, you're being crazy. Just let me go to bed," Helly says firmly, adrenaline starting to pump.</p><p>Helena's grip tightens even further. "I wasn't there for you when I should have been. I'm so sorry. I really am. Please, let me—"</p><p>"Helena, let go of me," Helly snaps, yanking her hand free with force. Helena recoils, eyes wide and shining, and in that split second she looks impossibly small, crumpled, on the verge of tears. </p><p>It slams Helly all at once like a bat to the ribs: Helena is just as broken as she is, but worse—she's terrified of her own brokenness. Helly had no choice but to get tough, to dig through the ruins and live with what she found. But Helena? She spent her whole life dancing around her pain, never naming it, never touching it. Just circling her own emptiness, terrified to fall in. Fragile where Helly is scarred over.</p><p>And Helly can see it now, can see the need rolling off her in desperate waves—how badly she wants Helly to fill her aching, bottomless void. </p><p>Helena clears her throat. "Sorry."</p><p>Helly can't grapple with what she's feeling. She hasn't felt this way since she was a kid. An overwhelming, feral need to protect the person in front of her. To do anything, <em> anything </em>to make her feel better. </p><p>It's horrid. Oppressive. </p><p>It makes her feel like she has purpose again.</p><p>"Fine, I'll sleep in your bed. Freak," she mutters, edge dulling on the sick, animal need to shield what's hers.</p><p>Helena just blinks, standing perfectly still. "Okay," she says softly, like anything more might frighten Helly and send her running.</p><p> </p><p align="center">─•~❉᯽❉~•─</p><p> </p><p>It's weird. It's really fucking weird. She knows Helena must think it's weird too. How could she not? It's objectively, overwhelmingly bizarre. </p><p>Yet there's an undeniable comfort to it, sharing a bed with the only person who ever felt like home, just like she used to, back when the world still seemed redeemable. </p><p>The big lights are off, but Helena's old nightlight glows softly between them, just enough to show the tension in both their bodies. Helly tries not to wonder why Helena still needs a nightlight—tries not to picture her sister, grown and delicate, still afraid of the dark. Something in Helly feels cracked open and raw. That old, stupid urge to protect Helena feels bigger than her resentment, more primitive than any rage she's carried. It's awful, how much she wants to fold Helena up and hold her in her arms, how the need edges into a kind of yearning she can't even name.</p><p>She turns her head and catches Helena watching her. Helena looks away as soon as their eyes meet. It's fucking weird, but oddly sweet. Earnest in a way Helly didn't know Helena was still capable of.</p><p>There's no way she's going to be able to relax enough to fall asleep. And from the look of it, Helena won't be able to either. She can't stand the idea of lying awake for the next eight hours, stuck in the liminal, awkward space of whatever this is. </p><p>"Um," Helly whispers, tossing anything she can into the silence. "You wash these sheets since you broke up with your boyfriend?"</p><p>Helena laughs. "Don't be gross. They're washed every day."</p><p>Helly smirks. "Just checking."</p><p>"I never fucked him in here anyway," Helena adds, almost offhand.</p><p>"Really? Why not?"</p><p>Helena shifts, suddenly looking uncomfortable. "We only had sex twice."</p><p>"Twice?" Helly's brow furrows. "The whole time you were together? Weren't you with him for years?"</p><p>"Yeah. I was."</p><p>Helly suddenly feels awful for what she said earlier. It would've stung either way, but being so completely wrong makes it twist even deeper.</p><p>"Stop judging me," Helena says, half-joking, but there's a rawness underneath. Helly almost scoffs—Helena, suddenly on the other side of judgment—but decides to be kind, for once, and goes for humor instead.</p><p>"He was that bad at making you come, huh?"</p><p>The vulgarity of it hangs in the air, startling both of them. Helly didn't realize how crude it would sound until it was already out—how the line between them is still blurred, boundaries unsettled and shifting.</p><p>Helena makes a face, bracing herself. "Yeah—I mean. No guy has ever made me do that."</p><p>"Do what?"</p><p>"What you just said."</p><p>"You've never had an orgasm with any of your boyfriends?" Helly asks, incredulous.</p><p>"I don't think so. I mean… I'm not sure."</p><p>"You'd know."</p><p>"Yeah. I haven't."</p><p>Jesus Christ. Helly can't even process it. Thoughts swirl, clashing and piling up in her head until she's lost in the haze. Helena isn't just broken or lonely—she's miserable in ways Helly never imagined. For a second, it feels less like Helena abandoned her, and more like she's the one who left Helena behind.</p><p>Underneath that tectonic shift, of guilt grinding over the fault line, comes an eruption not of anger or grief, but of something hotter—a perversion so intense it threatens to burn her alive. She needs to see Helena come, and she needs to be the one to make it happen.</p><p>
  <em> What the fuck? </em>
</p><p>She blinks. Just an intrusive thought. Clearly. It doesn't matter that it's accompanied by a sharp rush of blood between her legs, a heart beating too fast, a feeling in her stomach that's less nausea and more all-consuming. This is her sister. Her <em> sister</em>, who she could barely stand half an hour ago. She's not thinking straight. She's half drunk, half hungover, trapped in her stupid fucking childhood home. That's all it is. That's all.</p><p>"Helly," Helena whispers.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"I want to."</p><p>Helly swallows hard. "You want to what?"</p><p>"I want to feel it with you."</p><p>
  <em> Fuck. </em>
</p><p>She can't stop herself. She's reaching over before her brain can process what's happening, before she can stop herself. She feels crazed, hungry, <em> starving</em>. </p><p>She grabs Helena, yanks her close, presses her own chest flush against her sister's back. Her hand shoves straight under Helena's waistband, into her underwear, claiming her without a second thought. Helly's fingers drag through Helena's folds, soaked and desperate. </p><p>She pulls her even closer, puts her mouth right on Helena's ear. "How did you get this wet so fast?"</p><p>Helena lets out a shaky breath. "I—I don't know. I'm sorry."</p><p>Helly laughs, taken aback. "Why are you sorry?"</p><p>"I don't know."</p><p>Even with her sister's hand down her pants, Helena is still so fucking repressed, so wound tightly against her own shame. Helly grinds her middle finger into Helena's clit, rough and fast, breath hot and shaky on her neck. The anger burns up her spine—for all the years wasted, for the ache that never faded, for Helena always reaching for their father when Helly was the one built to keep her safe.</p><p>"Is this better than your cokehead boyfriend?" she breathes, low, almost cruel.</p><p>Helena can barely form the word, voice caught on a gasp. "<em>Yes</em>."</p><p>It's not enough. Helly's fury boils over. </p><p>She shoves two fingers inside her sister, fucking her rough and relentless, like she can erase all the damage, replace what their father carved out with her own flesh. </p><p>She wants Helena to come hard on her fingers, wants to see her lose control, wants to own it, wants to be the <em> only </em>one who can make her let go. Her own thighs are shaking with need, the throbbing between her legs so sharp it borders on agony, but all she can do is work Helena harder, faster, furious with need and love and hate and everything that's been sealed tight between them, finally breaking open.</p><p>She hates it—hates that it's always Helena, always her first, always this urge to give until there's nothing left. Even after seeing her so broken, so unimaginably fucked up, she resents her for it still. Resents that it'll always be like this. It was written into her bones before she was born, a contract signed before she could even say no.</p><p>She fucks her harder. She feels Helena squirm beneath her like she's on the edge but won't let herself get there.</p><p>"Let go," she says. "Come for me. Now."</p><p>"I—<em> fuck</em>. Helly, I don't know—if i can."</p><p>"Get out of your head," she commands. "Just let go."</p><p>She feels Helena try to relax into it, then tense up again. "I'm sorry, I don't think—"</p><p>"Shut up," Helly spits, yanking her harder against her, fucking her at a pace that borders on violence. "Shut the fuck up. It's happening."</p><p>She drives a third finger in, her other hand snaking beneath Helena's slight frame to grind her clit as her fingers pump deep. Helena writhes with a wild, primal intensity like she's being fucked out of her own body, the choice to finish taken away.</p><p>"Oh god—I can't—" Helena sobs, tears hot against Helly's lips as they stream down her cheek.</p><p>Helena shatters, her whole body locking up before she's convulsing, back arching, thighs trembling. She sobs Helly's name as she comes, the force of it merciless, unstoppable. Helly feels it first as a hot rush across her fingers, then a flood. Helena squirts all over her hand, down her wrist, soaking the sheets beneath them. It's everywhere—slick and hot and overwhelming, a mess that refuses to be contained. Helena thrashes, legs kicking, hands clutching at Helly's arm as wave after wave hits her, tears streaming down her face, mouth open in a soundless scream.</p><p>Helly keeps her hand buried deep, feeling every pulsing contraction, every aftershock. Her own fingers and palm are drenched, dripping with Helena's release. She can smell it, taste the salt of Helena's tears against her mouth. The sheets are ruined, the room heavy with the proof of what just happened, and all Helly can do is hold her through it, greedy for every last tremor, every ounce of the mess they've made together.</p><p>When Helena finally comes down, when Helly is certain she's wrung out every last wave, she pulls her hand away, fingers slick with Helena's release. Without hesitation, she shoves her hand into her own waistband, desperate. She's throbbing, nerves raw from being neglected, her need sharpened to a point.</p><p>It doesn't take much. A few rough, practiced circles over her clit—Helena's wetness easing the friction, every touch searing. The release rushes through her in seconds, less an explosion and more a deep, exhausted relief. She doesn't moan, just lets out a long, shaking sigh. The air finally draws back into her lungs, the weight she's been carrying finally, mercifully lifts.</p><p>She withdraws her hand—no need to linger—and drapes her arm back across Helena, pulling her tight against her chest, offering a fleeting sanctuary where the world can't touch her. She loves her baby sister. She loves her so fucking much it makes her sick.</p><p>She doesn't even realize that Helena's still crying until she hears a poorly muffled sob escape her lips. She figures she's just overwhelmed with emotion, finally letting go after years of being so repressed, so she lets her cry. But then Helena whispers something that breaks her heart in two. </p><p>"Sorry."</p><p>"Huh? What the fuck are you sorry for?"</p><p>"That was so embarrassing," Helena mumbles, face burrowed into the pillow. "I didn't mean to do that."</p><p>Helly cranes her neck, chasing her, and presses her cheek to Helena's. "You really can't enjoy anything, can you?"</p><p>Helena chokes out a laugh. "No."</p><p>"You should be thanking me, not apologizing."</p><p>"I guess you're right."</p><p>"You <em> guess</em>? You think I did all that so you could feel bad about it?"</p><p>"I don't know. I don't know why you did that."</p><p>Helly sighs, frustrated. She should've known this wouldn't fix anything. It probably only made things worse. Still, she just wanted a few easy, short-lived moments. But even after unraveling, Helena is still too tightly wound.</p><p>Helly sits up to get out of bed.</p><p>"Where are you going?" Helena asks, looking as stricken as a deer about to be abandoned.</p><p>"The guest room."</p><p>"Oh."</p><p>Helly pauses at the door, then glances back. "Aren't you coming? Unless you want to sleep in a soaked bed."</p><p>"Right. Yeah. Of course," Helena mutters, shaking her head, stripping out of her ruined pajamas and trailing after her.</p><p>Helly settles into the guest bed and holds her sister tightly. For the first time in weeks, sleep comes easy. Whatever else she's lost feels small compared to what's returned to her—this moment in time, this precious duty. That's enough to get her through the night.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>She wakes up with her head pounding, mouth dry, heart beating out of sync with her own body. The room is too bright, the sheets all wrong, and Helena is—<em> oh fuck</em>.</p><p>Her eyes fly open. The urge to bolt nearly overwhelms her, tempered only by the weight of her sister sleeping soundly in her arms. The night snaps into focus, harsher than the headache—what she did, what Helena <em> let </em> her do. <em> Asked </em>her to do.</p><p>It was the booze. It had to have been. She drank so much at the reception that she was still trashed by the time she got back to the estate. Everything before feeling her sister come on her fingers dissolves into a patchy blur, too many missing pieces to reconstruct how she'd gotten there. </p><p>But Helena? Not even close. Given how much Helly had outpaced her, Helena must have been stone-cold sober when they finally made it to bed.</p><p>Had that been her plan the entire time? Get Helly drunk and use her body to get off? Helena is even more deranged than she could've possibly imagined. Their father's rot, transplanted from his corpse straight into Helena's marrow. </p><p>She lets the memory stop circling and finally land, lets the full scope come into view so she can catalog the damage and analyze how truly depraved her sister is—how desperate, how entirely unwilling to let go. How she made Helly force it out of her, exploding all over the sheets.</p><p>Helly feels a rush of blood between her legs. <em> What the fuck? </em>She's sober now. Completely. She has the migraine to prove it. </p><p>Just a coincidence. She always wakes up horny. She snaps her eyes shut and tries to will it away. She feels Helena shift in her sleep, ever so slightly, exhaling the softest little noise.</p><p>Her clit throbs.</p><p>Whatever. <em> Whatever</em>. It's been a stressful few weeks and her body has its wires crossed. She gently lifts her arm off her sister, careful not to wake her, and rolls onto her back, putting a little bit of distance between them. Enough.</p><p>She misses the warmth immediately. Helena shivers a little in her sleep, curling tighter, like she feels the absence too. She looks so small, impossibly delicate with the sunlight catching her cheeks, freckles in perfect focus, mouth parted just enough to make her look heartbreakingly soft. For a split second, Helly just stares, breath caught, sick with how beautiful she is. All she can think about is how good it felt to have Helena pressed against her, open and trembling. How badly she wants it again.</p><p>Fuck. No she <em> doesn't</em>.</p><p>She tries to blink it away, to make herself forget. Tries to ignore the way her pulse pounds in her cunt, the ache turning from background noise to fire alarm. <em> Fine</em>. She'll just take care of it. Quick and quiet. Nothing to do with Helena. Just a thing her body needs, something automatic. </p><p>She closes her eyes, lets her hand drift under the sheets. The heat is unbearable, wetness slick between her fingers—her own, nothing like Helena's. Thicker, screaming for her attention. She teases her entrance, just long enough to gather the mess. She presses her finger to her clit and it's instant relief, like her body was waiting for permission, nerves all wound up and ready to snap.</p><p>She tries, really tries, to think of anything else. Memories of porn—her favorite: some blonde, tanned and fit, strapping a girl who looks like a hotter version of her ex. She focuses on the image, breath shaking, so close already it almost hurts. But then Helena's face bursts through—flushed, eyes wide and glassy, that look of being cracked open by Helly's hands—and it's over. She comes hard, biting her lip to muffle the sound, thighs shaking uncontrollably. Her mind is hot with it, the afterimage of Helena burned in so deep she knows she'll never get it out.</p><p>She opens her eyes and nearly jumps. Helena's awake, staring at her. God knows how long she's been watching.</p><p>"Jesus," Helly snaps, yanking her hand out from under the sheets. "I thought you were asleep."</p><p>Helena doesn't blink, just tips her head, hair mussed, eyes heavy. "I was. You were shaking the bed."</p><p>Helly feels the flush climb up her neck. The embarrassment calcifies around her throat. For once, she has nothing to say. </p><p>"It's fine, really. I don't care," Helena says. "How do you finish so fast?"</p><p><em> Christ</em>. She has to get out of this fucking house. </p><p>"I'm just gonna take a shower," Helly says, darting out of bed.</p><p>"Yeah, good idea. I need one too," Helena responds, trailing after her. </p><p>Helly reaches the bathroom, about to shut the door, when Helena pokes in through the frame.</p><p>"What—"</p><p>"Don't worry, there's plenty of room," Helena says, as if that were the issue. As if Helly had simply forgotten what a rich-person shower looks like after years of scraping by.</p><p>Helly exhales sharply. "Just—can I have, like, five minutes to myself?"</p><p>Helena recoils slightly. "Did I do something wrong?"</p><p>Helly wants to scream. <em> Yes</em>. Obviously. But she doesn't want to get into it. She can't stomach yelling at Helena just to watch her crumple again, twist the guilt right back around like always. Just another tactic, and she's tired of falling for it.</p><p>"I just need a few minutes, Helena. Please," she says, neutral. As polite as she can be.</p><p>Helena frowns. "Right. Okay. I'll just use the other shower then."</p><p>She stares at Helly for a few stretched, unpleasant seconds, like Helly might suddenly change her mind.</p><p>Helly's had her fair share of stage-five clingers over the years—needy girls who latch on after one-night stands, convinced she's going to fix whatever's broken inside them. She often wonders what it is about her that draws them in. Now, standing here in this awkward staring contest, the clarity hits all at once: her sister was the blueprint. The first girl who ever needed her that way, who made her believe she was special enough to be someone's savior. She just never imagined she'd end up fucking her, too.</p><p>Helly sighs, realizing Helena isn't going to leave unless she says something. "Okay. See you later."</p><p>Helena nods and slips out.</p><p>For a moment, Helly considers throwing up again. She feels like she could—it might ease the pressure behind her eyes, purge whatever rot is festering inside her. She ultimately decides against it, if only so Helena won't hear and come running back, desperate to "help."</p><p>She turns the water on, letting it scald her. She <em> has </em>to get out of here today, sooner than later. She can't even think about what comes next, if anything does. There are some things you just don't come back from. Helly's built a whole life on that principle. </p><p>It's almost funny how it keeps happening. Different cities, different women, same inevitable collapse. Like she's got some internal timer counting down to detonation. Three months, six if she's lucky, then <em> boom</em>, everything collapses, and Helly's halfway to the next state before the smoke clears.</p><p>But this is a new low, even for her. A type of insanity she could have never even imagined, yet somehow it feels inevitable. Of course. Of course it was always going to happen this way. This sick fucking family—the Eagans and their gothic horror show of a legacy. All those portraits in the hallway, generation after generation of sharp-cheeked men and hollow-eyed women, their features repeating with eerie precision, a secret no one dared dilute.</p><p>At least she can't get her sister pregnant by accident—she's pretty sure Helena would poke a hole in the condom if that were an option. She takes comfort in knowing the sickness dies with them.</p><p>She turns the shower off, and—right on cue—a knock on the door.</p><p>Helly cracks the door open slightly. Closed enough to preserve some delusional sense of modesty, open enough for Helena to peek right in and see her naked anyway. Helena's eyes dart straight to Helly's bare chest. Only for a second, then back up, like the swiftness might keep Helly from noticing. It makes sense, she supposes, that Helena would be curious. Helly's breasts are noticeably bigger—probably the result of getting proper nutrition her whole life.</p><p>"God, Helena—what?" Helly asks, not bothering to hide the fact her sister is getting on her last nerve.</p><p>Helena hands her a towel and furrows her brow. "You're welcome."</p><p>Helly takes the towel and closes the door. There are at least a dozen more, neatly folded on every rack in the bathroom. She rolls her eyes. But then she glances down at the one in her hand and the past rushes in like the tide reclaiming the shore.</p><p>Her favorite. Pale blue with little embroidered starfish and seashells and memories of a better life, soft from overuse, the edges fraying. She'd spotted it in a shop window during their week in a sleepy beach town. She was nine, sunburned and giddy, her legs caked with sand. She'd asked Father so politely if she could have it. He bought it without hesitation, ruffled her hair. Back when he still did things like that. Back when she believed that meant he loved her. She used the towel every day until she was sixteen, until it vanished from the linen closet without explanation, like so many other soft, beautiful things in her life that simply stopped being hers.</p><p>It hits her hard. Not just the towel—the contrast. How much has changed. Her life, sure, but this house, too. The bathroom is completely redone: new counters, modern drawer pulls, a muted color scheme. Sleek and controlled. It feels very Helena. Come to think of it, so does the rest of this wing.</p><p>She wraps the towel around herself and opens the door. No need to look far. Helena's still there, hovering like a puppy tied to a post outside a coffee shop, waiting patiently for her owner to return.</p><p>"Hey—" Helena starts, smiling.</p><p>"How sick was Father towards the end?" Helly interrupts.</p><p>Helena lifts a brow. "He wasn't sick."</p><p>"So he just died? Randomly?"</p><p>Her smile fades. "It wasn't <em> random,</em> he was eighty-six."</p><p>Helly chews on her lip. "But he was normal before that? Here one day, gone the next?"</p><p>"Unfortunately. Same old Father right up to the very end." Helena tilts her head. "Why do you ask?"</p><p>"Just curious."</p><p>Father never let Helena have a single thing to herself growing up—certainly not stylistic control over an entire wing of his house. But maybe he needed to let the prisoner think she's free as she aged out of his direct command. Makes sense, and she doesn't have time to dwell on it further. Not with Helena looking at her like she just spotted Jesus Christ walking barefoot through downtown.</p><p>"Can you please stop looking at me like that?" Helly finally snaps. She's even more insufferable now than when she was miserable.</p><p>"Is everything okay? You're acting really weird," Helena says.</p><p>"What the fuck? <em> You're </em> the one being weird. Acting needier than my last five girlfriends combined."</p><p>Helena scoffs. "I'm not—"</p><p>"<em>Yes</em> you are. Stop treating me like I'm your boyfriend. It's fucking weird."</p><p>"My boyfriend?" Helena flinches. "Helly, you don't think…?"</p><p>Helly cranes her neck, lifts a brow, waiting.</p><p>"You don't think I'm <em> attracted </em>to you, right?" Helena asks.</p><p>She blinks.</p><p>"I hope I didn't confuse you last night," Helena goes on. "We were both a little drunk. Emotional from the funeral."</p><p>Helly just stares, waiting for Helena to say anything that makes sense.</p><p>"I know you like girls, but for Christ's sake Helly—I'm your <em> sister</em>."</p><p>The implication slams into her, like Helly's some sort of predatory dyke, just waiting for the chance to fuck her sister because she has a pussy.</p><p>"You're such a fucking cunt. Still." Helly digs her nails into her palms. "You literally asked me to do it."</p><p>"And you did it."</p><p>She has to get out of this <em> fucking </em>house.</p><p>Helena shrugs. "Listen, Helly, it's fine. I'm not mad."</p><p>Oh good. Thank <em> god</em>.</p><p>Helena continues. "Let's just reset. Have some breakfast and figure out the situation with Father's will. Is that okay?"</p><p>No. It's certainly <em> not</em>. She'd say so if she could form a single coherent sentence. Helena's complete rewrite of reality leaves her speechless. She brushes past her, finds her dress crumpled on the floor, and drops her towel. As she pulls the dress up, she turns. Helena's still staring. Of course she is.</p><p>She dresses fast and shoulders past her again.</p><p>"Where are you going?"</p><p>She doesn't answer. There's nothing she could say that Helena wouldn't twist. She just keeps walking. She needs to get out. Away from her sister, this house, this town, and never come back.</p><p>She picks up her pace to a near jog down the stairs. Helena follows, just as fast. Helly shoves open the front door and steps out, only to find the driveway empty.</p><p>"Where's my car?" Helly snaps.</p><p>"Oh my god, would you calm down? I'm having it serviced for you," Helena says, her voice low.</p><p>"Serviced? When did you even have time to set that up?"</p><p>"When you were in the shower," she says, stepping beside her. "I noticed it's in rough shape. I thought it would be a nice surprise."</p><p>Helly stares at her. "You fucking trapped me here."</p><p>"Can you <em> please </em> stop freaking out?" Helena steps in front of her, hands settling lightly on her shoulders. "Helly. Look at me. Father is dead. I'm not him."</p><p>Helly looks her sister in the eye and sees it—how truly batshit insane she is. That should terrify her. The panic, the fury, the shame, <em> any </em>of it should take priority. But one long look is all it takes. Something in Helena's eyes drags her right back, cuts through everything else like it always has. </p><p>Maybe Helena's right. Maybe she <em> is </em>overreacting. Emotions are high. It's possible she misread the whole thing. And what's the alternative? She has no one else. No money. Nowhere to go. If there's even a chance Helena is telling the truth, it's worth sticking around—at least until she has the means to leave.</p><p>Her stomach growls.</p><p>"How long until they bring my car back?"</p><p>"It'll be here this afternoon."</p><p>Helly sighs. "What do you have to eat around here anyway?"</p><p> </p><p align="center">─•~❉᯽❉~•─</p><p> </p><p>The dining room is already set when Helly walks in, sunlight pouring through the windows with such cinematic perfection it feels deliberately cast. A long table stretches out in front of her, covered edge to edge in a curated buffet: fresh croissants still steaming, ripe fruit arranged like a painting, eggs every way imaginable, avocado toast with edible flowers, tiny glass jars of yogurt and honey, rows of pressed juices in gradient hues. There's even a chafing dish with mini quiches and little silver tongs beside it. It feels so absurd she actually laughs.</p><p>She hasn't seen food like this in years. Even as a kid, the vast majority of breakfasts were a model of Kier's—three raw eggs in milk. Rarely a spread like this in her own home. It makes her stomach rumble so loud it echoes off the ceiling.</p><p>"What the hell is all this?" she mutters, reaching for a plate.</p><p>"I wanted to make sure you were fed," Helena says simply. "It's a special occasion, you being back here and all."</p><p>The implication sends a chill down her spine. She hadn't planned on coming here. None of this was planned. So how the fuck did Helena have time to set up a five-star buffet?</p><p>She opens her mouth to ask, then stops. Too hungry to get into all of that. She piles her plate high with at least one of everything, except the eggs. Even cooked, she can't stomach them anymore. She digs in shamelessly, stuffing her face like she hasn't eaten anything good in days, because really, she hasn't. Leftovers, gas station snacks, half a box of stale cereal. This might be the first real meal she's had since Christmas.</p><p>She looks up mid-bite and nearly gags. Helena's breakfast consists of a single hard-boiled egg, peeled and sliced into six perfect wedges. She's eating it one piece at a time, tiny bite after tiny bite, chewing so carefully it barely counts as eating at all. Disturbing as it is sad.</p><p>"Looks delicious," Helly says, face scrunched up.</p><p>"It's functional," Helena responds, shrugging.</p><p>Except it most certainly isn't. There's no way Helena is surviving on seventy calories until lunch, or whenever she decides to eat next. Helly can't stand to look at it anymore. She brings her plate around to Helena and transfers a few mini quiches and biscuits from her plate to her sister's.</p><p>"You gotta try these," Helly says, nudging her shoulder. "They're really good."</p><p>Helena looks up, something between panic and irritation etched across her face. "I just don't have much of an appetite in the mornings."</p><p>"Just try them. One bite."</p><p>"I'm fine, really."</p><p>"Come on—"</p><p>"<em>No,</em>" Helena snaps, loud enough to make Helly flinch. It startles even her.</p><p>Across the room, the staff glance over, then quickly return to their tasks, eyes down. Helena pushes her plate away—half the egg still untouched—wipes her hands with a napkin, and excuses herself. She walks out briskly, half-balled fists at her sides.</p><p>Helly watches, stunned. She can't remember the last time Helena had anything resembling an outburst. Maybe when their father tried to make Helena perform in a ballet recital. She had stage fright—cried and screamed and managed to get out of it, but got the belt at home. That was the last time she saw her so much as raise her voice. </p><p>She was six.</p><p>Helly sets her plate down. For the first time in her life, her appetite is gone.</p><p> </p><p align="center">─•~❉᯽❉~•─</p><p> </p><p>Helly kills a few hours by wandering around the labyrinth. It feels like it's been lifetimes since she walked these halls. A ghost retracing her own footsteps. Every corner brings back some piece of a memory. Piano lessons, silent dinners, hidden bruises. As shitty as her life has been post-Eagan, nothing compares to the suffocation of living here.</p><p>She loops around to the front just as the sun starts to dip behind the trees. And there it is—her car, parked neatly back in the driveway. She exhales, relieved. </p><p>She climbs in, shuts the door, and rests her forehead against the steering wheel. Finally. She can't believe Helena is actually letting her leave. She pumps the brakes a few times, just to make sure her sister didn't cut them. </p><p>She takes a deep breath.</p><p>Maybe she's being too hard on her. Maybe Helena's right. She's not the monster—Father was. Helena's just the only one left to be angry at. And she's just as gutted by the same fucked-up life, held under even longer.</p><p>Fuck. She can't just leave her here. </p><p>Goddammit.</p><p>She cuts the engine. Slams the door harder than necessary. Heads back over to Helena's wing.</p><p>Tucked behind a frosted glass door is another room she doesn't recognize. A minimalist, sleek home office. The kind of workspace you build when you want to feel like a person who's in control of their life.</p><p>She pushes the door open and lingers in the frame. "Hey."</p><p>"They can't go one fucking day without me," Helena mutters without looking up, typing furiously at her laptop. "I take time off for a death in the family and come back to eight fires and a fucking circus. These people are either incompetent or suicidal."</p><p>Helly coughs out a half-laugh. She doesn't know what to say.</p><p>Helena finally looks up. Her expression doesn't soften. "What?" she asks flatly. "Isn't your car back?"</p><p>Helly misses the warmth from earlier. Desperately. She hadn't noticed how good it felt until it was gone, sunlight stripped away behind a cloud she didn't see coming. Now she's freezing in its absence. She feels like an asshole. A cruel one, even. All she wants is for Helena to look at her the same way she did only hours ago. Instead, she's getting the stare Helena probably reserves for some idiot in accounting who just blew a quarterly report.</p><p>"Can I stay here tonight?" she blurts, the words out before she can stop them. They scrape at her throat on the way up. Just asking feels like forfeiting ground she swore she'd never give back. But she needs it. Needs one more night with Helena, whatever it costs.</p><p>"Of course," Helena says, expression still cold. "You don't have to ask."</p><p>"Thanks." Helly nods. "Hey, um…" She slaps the doorframe lightly, shifts her weight. "Sorry I freaked out on you earlier."</p><p>"It's fine."</p><p>"Okay." It doesn't sound fine. Helena's holding onto it. Tight. Maybe Helly deserves it. Maybe not. Either way, it'd be nice if she'd just say so. Just name it. Something. "You sure?"</p><p>"Helly, please. I'm dealing with something at work."</p><p>"Right. Sorry." Helly slips out and closes the door gently. She stands in the hallway, feeling unmoored, like her grip on reality is sliding out from under her. </p><p>She <em> had </em> Helena. Last night, this morning—right there in her arms, soft and clinging. Helena isn't that way for <em> anyone</em>. But she was for Helly. And she fucked it up, because…? She can't even think of a reason. She's so utterly baffled she wants to peel herself out of her own skin, kick a hole through the floorboards, do anything but sit with the truth that she ruined it. </p><p>She decides on raiding the liquor cabinet instead.</p><p> </p><p align="center">─•~❉᯽❉~•─</p><p> </p><p>She paces herself tonight. On the off chance Helena decides she can stand being in the same room as her again, she doesn't want to make a fool of herself. Just four shots over two hours. The slowest she's gone since freshman year, before she learned that blacking out was the easiest way to forget how fucked everything was.</p><p>She's not trying to spiral, just trying to dull the edges. To breathe a little easier under the weight of a reality that keeps pressing in from all sides. Her thumb hovers over a name in her contacts—her ex. The one who walked out just days ago. The one their so-called friends staged an intervention for, like they were saving her from something toxic. Like Helly was dangerous. Irredeemable. Just because things got rocky. As if that isn't every relationship worth anything.</p><p>She decides to text her. She has nothing to lose.</p><p>
  <em> Hey. I'm so sorry for everything. I really am. I just needed time to process what you said. I've processed. Can we grab a drink this weekend and talk things out? </em>
</p><p>She hits send before she can change her mind, then quickly locks her phone and sets it down. It buzzes almost instantly.</p><p>
  <em> This user is not accepting messages from this number. </em>
</p><p>Whatever. Fuck her and fuck her fairweather friends. She's used to being abandoned by everyone she cares about. </p><p>"Hey."</p><p>Couldn't have timed it better. The first person to ever do it. Helly snaps her head around and sees Helena leaning up against the wall behind the couch. </p><p>"Hey," Helly responds, not bothering to hide the sorrow in her voice.</p><p>"Having a bad night?"</p><p>"More like a bad life," Helly scoffs.</p><p>"I can relate." Helena circles around, pours herself a drink. "Mind if I join you?"</p><p> </p><p align="center">─•~❉᯽❉~•─</p><p> </p><p>"—to add insult to injury, Debra didn't even bother proofreading the email before sending it to our entire board of directors."</p><p>"That cunt," Helly cracks.</p><p>"I hate all of them," Helena groans, slamming back the rest of her drink like it's water. She's already outpacing Helly, and she can't hold her liquor even half as well. The slip is subtle, but there. It's in the way her hair falls out of place, the way her eyes glaze over. It's intoxicating to watch her composure crack, even just a little. Helly feels herself pulled in, helpless to swim against the warm, dangerous current.</p><p>"You should just fire everyone," Helly suggests.</p><p>Helena laughs. "It's a good thing you're not running this place."</p><p>"Fair," Helly shrugs, taking another sip. "If nothing else, Father had that one right."</p><p>Helena exhales. Her skirt catches under her as she sinks lower into the couch, the hem creeping up her thigh with every breath. Helly's eyes catch the exposed skin, smooth and pale and soft. Her legs are slight, delicate, defined in a way that makes it impossible not to notice. Not built necessarily, but something carved carefully out of restraint.</p><p>After staring longer than she should—definitely long enough to be obvious—Helly drags her gaze back up. Helena's looking at her. Intense. The most blatant "fuck me" eyes she's ever seen on a woman. Helly's breath catches.</p><p>"You want to again?" Helly asks quietly, and instantly hates how it lands. Too tentative, not her tone. She doesn't ask. She <em> never </em>asks. She's used to being the one women chase, used to being wanted, taking what's hers without a second thought. The hesitation clings to her like a stain on her record.</p><p>Helena tilts her head. "What?"</p><p>God. She really doesn't want to spell this out. Hates how fucking pathetic she must look. But she is—pathetic and desperate and completely at Helena's mercy. "I saw you—uh," she pauses. Awkwardly smiles. Chokes out a laugh. "You were looking at me like you want me to fuck you."</p><p>Helena stands, a smirk tugging at her mouth. Helly feels a rush of heat gather low. </p><p>"You should probably get your eyes checked then." Helena walks over to grab another bottle of wine.</p><p>Helly swallows. She really is losing it. "Okay. I just thought…"</p><p>Helena looks back, waiting patiently.</p><p>"Never mind."</p><p>Helena returns with the bottle, silent. She pauses in front of Helly—just long enough to make her stomach flip—then shifts forward and drapes herself onto Helly's lap. Her back rests against the arm of the couch, legs stretched across Helly's thighs like she owns her, like she knows exactly what she's doing.</p><p>Helly forgets how to breathe. Her hands stay frozen at her sides, every nerve in her body screaming to touch. Her sister's weight, the scent of her, the subtle rise and fall of her chest, it all short-circuits her brain. She can't think. Can't move. She just sits there, paralyzed, wet, dizzy.</p><p>"I think you just missed me," Helena says, looking up, cupping Helly's cheek. "It's confusing you."</p><p>Helly's heart slams against her ribs. Words fail her. She just stares into Helena's eyes, breath caught, throat tight, drowning in a feeling no girlfriend ever managed to drag out of her, no matter how hard they tried.</p><p>"We were never meant to be apart," Helena continues. "Not ever. And especially not for so long." </p><p>"Yeah," Helly finally manages.</p><p>"That's my fault." Helena strokes her gently, thumb tracing the curve of her cheekbone down to her jaw. "You just hated me so much by the end. I figured you'd never want anything to do with me."</p><p>The words cut through the haze and land like a blow. </p><p>"I never hated you, Helena," Helly says firmly. The thought makes her sick. Even when she couldn't stand her, when the sight of her turned her stomach, she didn't hate her. She resented the fuck out of her. Let that resentment build until it was easier to look away than to face what was happening. But she <em> never </em>hated her.</p><p>"You didn't?" Helena asks softly.</p><p>"Are you joking?" Helly scoffs. "I would've dropped everything for you if you just would've asked."</p><p>Helena's brow creases, eyes widening just slightly, like she can't quite believe it. "Really?"</p><p>"I would do anything for you," Helly says, voice thick with conviction. Her hands finally move—one rising to cup the back of Helena's head where it rests against the arm of the couch, fingers threading into her hair with tenderness. The other slides up her thigh, warm and firm and anchoring. A promise made flesh.</p><p>They stay like that for a few long, loaded seconds. Then, softly, like she's testing the air, Helena asks: "What would you do?"</p><p>Helly's hand moves higher, slowly, intentionally. Her nails trail lightly over Helena's skin—enough to hint at something darker hiding beneath the surface. "What do you want me to do?"</p><p>Helena's breath hitches. An obvious tell. Maybe one she would've been able to hide better if she wasn't sloshed. Her eyes don't leave Helly's. "I want you to do whatever you want."</p><p>Helly's head is swimming, every rational thought drowned out by her throbbing cunt. Every ounce of self-preservation burned away by a single, undeniable truth: she has never, in her entire fucked-up life, wanted anyone more than she wants her sister right now.</p><p>Her hand moves on its own, sliding up, pushing the fabric of her skirt higher, slowly, all the way to the top where it meets the edge of her underwear. She spreads Helena open just a bit, enough, and runs her fingers right over her center, pressing down. She feels it through the barrier—already dripping through. </p><p>Just a little friction, a slow, deliberate circle of her middle finger against the thin fabric is all it takes for the softest little noise to escape Helena's lips. The sound shoots straight through Helly. She feels a shiver rack her own frame in response. Helena catches it, the ghost of a smirk touching her lips for a fraction of a second.</p><p>Helly hooks her fingers around Helena's underwear, pulling it to the side. She doesn't bother to take them off, couldn't stand to lose the grounding weight, the addicting warmth of her sister on her lap. Her index finger teases her, and she appreciates the feeling for a moment—collecting the slick heat, feeling Helena's entrance tighten around the pad of her finger like it's begging for something, anything, to clench around.</p><p>Helena moans, audibly this time. A low, guttural sound of surrender that vibrates right back through Helly. Her gaze snaps from her own work right back to Helena's eyes. They're wide, pupils blown, her lips parted and wet, cheeks flushed a deep, feverish red. She looks crazed. Hers.</p><p>She pushes a finger in and Helena whimpers, hips tilting up to meet her. Helly follows with a second, no pause, curling them just enough to press where she knows it'll land. She doesn't have to guess. Same DNA, same body. She knows what it feels like, knows how to make her feel good.</p><p> It's driving Helly mad, all of it—her sister on her lap, fingers buried deep inside her cunt, the quiet, desperate sounds she's making. It's sickening how right it feels. How anything other than this would feel dead wrong, a pale imitation of a truth she's been running from her entire life. </p><p>She starts to work her fingers in a steady, claiming rhythm, her thumb slipping up to find Helena's clit, pressing down. Her other hand stays where it's been, holding carefully around the back of Helena's neck, keeping her head from hitting the hard edge of the couch arm. Keeping her comfortable. Cradling her like her own precious thing to protect and take care of.</p><p>She moves slowly. Tender, careful. There's no rush. No need to fuck it out of her fast and hard. She wants it to last. Wants to feel every second of it. Wants Helena to feel that she's not going anywhere. The longer it goes, the longer they can both pretend they're full. That nothing's missing. Even if it's a lie with an expiration date, already starting to spoil.</p><p>The minutes stretch, long enough that time stops registering. Steady, meditative. Helena's looking up at her with that soft, constant pleasure, soaking in the intimacy, the attention. Helly can see it all over her face, how much she missed her big sister. The only one who ever tried to keep the rot out. And now here she is, back under Helly who burns like a heat lamp, lighting up that same damage, exposing and burning it clean.</p><p>"You gonna come for me soon?" Helly asks, voice barely above a whisper.</p><p>Helena shakes her head, lets out an uneven breath. "This is enough."</p><p>"You sure?"</p><p>"I just want to feel close to you."</p><p>Something splitting and holy lodges in Helly's chest. Helena's voice, quiet and certain, strikes a chord deep in her, reverberating like a vow she doesn't remember making but lives by anyway, stitched into her softest parts. </p><p>She wants to keep Helena wrapped up in this moment, trembling and safe. Wants to be the only one she ever reaches for again.</p><p>"Sure," Helly responds, keeping pace, gentle and reverent. "Whatever you want."</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Not once, in her thirty-five years on this planet, has Helly ever had trouble making a girl come.</p><p>She was eighteen the first time she had sex, sick with nerves and the need to prove something to herself. It was at a house party thrown by her new friends from college—an invitation that required sneaking out of the estate.</p><p>She caught the eye of a tall, older butch who wasn't really her type but seemed safe enough. The woman led her to one of the bedrooms with a confident gait and patient eyes. When she tried to go down on Helly, the panic hit immediately. Helly redirected her with shaking hands, then turned off the lights, suddenly feeling far too exposed.</p><p>The woman didn't push, didn't ask questions, just worked her fingers with patience until Helly came, clinical and quick, like checking a box. When Helly returned the favor, clumsy and determined, she focused entirely on technique, on getting it right, on making the woman arch and gasp beneath her. The accomplishment felt hollow, but necessary. Proof she could be normal. That she could perform intimacy convincingly enough to pass. It wasn't enjoyable—not in the way something like that should be—but it was enough to make her want to try again with someone else.</p><p>Over time, sex stopped feeling like an exam she'd barely passed. Giving other women pleasure became a skill, one of her best. One of the few things she obsessed over, perfected. If she could make them feel good enough, maybe they wouldn't notice when she didn't let them go down on her—or, some nights, even touch her at all.</p><p>It's not that she doesn't enjoy the release. Of course she does. She just enjoys it more alone, with her own practiced touch, replaying memories of the pleasure she gave other women. Not their pleasure exactly, but the fact that it came from her. From her hands. Like that made her worth something.</p><p>So sitting here now, with her sister in her lap—forty minutes deep into every trick she knows from this angle, at this pace, her hand half-asleep and still no closer to making Helena come—feels, to put it mildly, like failure.</p><p>It's never taken even half this long before. She knows it's not happening. Knows Helena doesn't really care, or maybe doesn't even really want it. She just lies there, perfectly content, looking up at her like she's being given the first real taste of pleasure in her life. And maybe she is. The thought that it's only ever come from her hands, that she's the one who gets to give this to Helena, sends a shiver down her spine.</p><p>She's so fucking horny it hurts.</p><p>Helena gently places a hand on Helly's wrist, coaxing her out. "I'm getting a little sore."</p><p>Helly misses the heat instantly. Her fingers hit the cold air, slick with Helena's arousal, and she has to fight the nearly overwhelming urge to slip them into her mouth. Or maybe Helena's. Let her taste herself.</p><p>She shivers again.</p><p>"You look worked up," Helena points out. "Was that turning you on?"</p><p>What a stupid question. She's sure Helena just wants her to say it out loud. To make her squirm by admitting she's soaking wet from finger-fucking her sister for the better part of an hour.</p><p>Whatever.</p><p>"Yeah."</p><p>"Okay," Helena says simply. Neutral. No judgment, no curiosity, no hint of a follow-up.</p><p>Helly just stares at her. She has no framework for this. No idea what she's allowed to want, let alone ask for. All she knows is that she's aching for release.</p><p>Helena smiles and reaches up to cup Helly's face again, tracing the sharp lines, not as pronounced as her own, but still strong. Looking at Helly like she hung the moon.</p><p>Helly can't take it anymore. "Helena, please…"</p><p>"Do you need to finish?"</p><p>It's such a strange way to phrase it. No one's ever asked her that before—at least not with that kind of implication. She's never thought of it as a <em> need</em>. But in this moment, it hits her exactly how much it is one. How she might actually lose the last shred of her sanity if she doesn't get it.</p><p>"Yeah, would you mind?" Helly concedes.</p><p>"I really don't know how."</p><p>"It's just like touching yourself."</p><p>"I've never done that."</p><p>Jesus fucking Christ. It never ends.</p><p>"You don't have to be that good at it," Helly pushes. "I'm… really almost there."</p><p>Helena's brows shoot up, a smirk overtaking her face. "Wow."</p><p>Helly sighs, getting frustrated. "Come on. Just—yes or no, don't leave me hanging."</p><p>"You should touch yourself."</p><p>Helly blinks. "What?"</p><p>"You know how to do it," Helena shrugs. "I don't."</p><p>She wants Helena's hand—wants it so badly it's making her dizzy. But Helly won't sit here begging for it all night. She swallows it instead, stewing in the want, in the maddening irony of it all, fingers twitching uselessly at her sides.</p><p>"Okay. Fine," Helly says. "You want me to, like… do it in front of you?"</p><p>Helena can't help but smile, laugh a bit. "That's the idea."</p><p>Suddenly, she feels self-conscious. But she can see it in Helena's eyes—past the manufactured indifference to the raw want underneath. Her pupils are blown wide, her breath catches in soft, irregular patterns. Maybe she could fool anyone else, but not Helly. The realization steadies her, gives her the nerve to shimmy her dress up, spread her legs just enough to slip her hand beneath her waistband.</p><p>"No, take them off," Helena demands. "I want to see."</p><p>The command is so direct, so brazen, she almost comes from that alone. Helly just nods stupidly, lifting Helena's legs just enough to slide her underwear down. Helena props herself up on her arms for a better view, watching with undeniable curiosity. Helly is charting familiar territory Helena has never dared to navigate herself.</p><p>"Um, do you want me to like… explain what I'm doing?" Helly offers.</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>What the fuck does she mean, <em> why</em>. She's the one acting like this is her one and only opportunity to learn how to masturbate.</p><p>"I don't know, never mind."</p><p>"No, you can," Helena says, looking back up at her with wide eyes. "It's fine. Go ahead."</p><p>Helly sighs. "Okay, so," she moves her hand down, spreads her lips just a bit. "This is the clit, and—"</p><p>Helena interrupts her with a burst of laughter. "Christ, Helly, I know what a fucking clit is."</p><p>"Well—"</p><p>"Do you think I'm twelve?"</p><p>Helly drops her hand. Takes a deep breath. Nothing is ever easy.</p><p>"I'm sorry," Helena purses her lips, stemming her laughter. "Sorry. Really. Go on."</p><p>"Whatever, I'm done explaining."</p><p>"That's <em> fine</em>. I didn't ask you to."</p><p>"Whatever." Helly rolls her eyes.</p><p>"You don't have to get upset about it."</p><p>"You are so fucking annoying. Seriously."</p><p>Helena lays back again, resting her head, folding her hands over her chest. "Are you gonna touch yourself or not?"</p><p>She hates being at Helena's mercy like this. Trapped by her own desperate need and the calculated withholding of the person who created it. She doesn't bother responding. Might as well just get on with it.</p><p>She fixes her gaze ahead, trying to find her nerve again. Moves her hand over her clit, starts with small, practiced circles. It really won't take long. She's been desperately aching for this since the first finger slipped inside Helena. She's almost surprised she didn't come in her pants.</p><p>She glances back at her sister. Helena is watching her intently—not her hand or what it's doing, but her face. Helly can feel the way her gaze sharpens whenever her breath stutters, the slight tilt of her head when her expression slips. There's the faintest twitch at the corner of Helena's mouth, quietly enjoying every second of Helly coming undone.</p><p>"You're almost there," Helena says with the tone of someone taking notes. It's a performance that crumbles at the edges. It's in her breathing, in the way her eyes devour what her voice pretends to merely observe.</p><p>It's pathetic—just the sound of Helena's voice, clinical as it is, sends her over the edge. She comes hard, all that pent-up need from forty minutes of torture exploding through her in waves she can't control. Her body convulses, head falling back, mouth open, making sounds she'd be embarrassed by if she could think straight.</p><p>When she finally comes down and slips her hand away, Helena is watching her, unable to hide her satisfaction—like nothing about tonight could have gone better. Helly played right into her hands.</p><p>"You really needed that," Helena says, making no effort to hide how pleased she is with her own assessment.</p><p>Helly scoffs, sinking into the couch, too drunk on her own release to care about whatever game Helena's playing.</p><p>"You liked watching," she tries, poorly, to mimic her sister's detached delivery.</p><p>Helena reaches up to run her fingers through Helly's hair, unfazed. "Thanks for the show."</p><p>Helly doesn't know how to parse any of this. She knows that something here is deeply wrong. Not just the act itself—that much is obvious—but the way Helena seems to slip in and out of connection, like she's testing which version of herself gets the best response. It makes Helly wonder if Helena's fundamental brokenness has evolved into something more dangerous: a kind of emptiness that learns to mimic love. But the thought only strengthens her resolve. If Helena has become a monster, it's because no one ever fought to keep her human.</p><p>It's not too late. It can't be.</p><p>She wants to kiss her. Wants to lean down and close the distance and taste the wine on her lips, taste the need huffed out from the back of her throat, taste the bitter years of longing, fermented sweet and sick on her tongue.</p><p>Something about that seems like crossing a line they can't come back from. As if the rest of this wasn't dangerous enough. The rules are absurd, the lines so blurred they barely exist, but this feels different. Stepping out of the safety of giving and into the danger of wanting something back.</p><p>She tries to just enjoy the weight of Helena on her lap, the familiar ache of loving from a distance, but the urge claws at her. If she can't dissolve into her sister completely, she needs to at least taste what she's been starving for.</p><p>"Hey, come here," she says, sliding her arm under Helena's back, lifting her until their faces nearly touch. She suspends her there, gazing into her eyes, feeling Helena's humid breath settle on her lips, sticky and warm and intoxicating.</p><p>Helena tilts her head a fraction, smile pulling at the corner of her mouth. Her fingers move through Helly's hair, hand settling warm on her shoulder. "What?"</p><p>Helly exhales gently, amused. Of course Helena is going to make her do the whole thing. She wants to feel wanted. Needs it. And Helly has never felt more at home being the one to give it.</p><p>Helly closes the distance, inhaling sharply as their lips meet in the barest touch, catching and sticking where her own bottom lip is chapped and rough. She shifts the angle, nose grazing Helena's, then presses deeper. Her lips part to taste Helena's soft, sweet flesh with the tip of her tongue. It's so delicious, so overwhelming she can't suppress the moan that tears from her throat, the sound vibrating directly into Helena's mouth.</p><p>Helena stays perfectly still, caught between yielding and withdrawing, until Helly moves to deepen the kiss. Then she pulls back, breaking the spell.</p><p>"Mm," Helena hums, smiling softly, her eyes meeting Helly's for just a moment before drifting away. "Let's maybe… not do that."</p><p>Helly shakes her head like she didn't hear her right. "Huh?"</p><p>"Helly," she says gently, pressing her cheek to her sister's, wrapping her arms around her. "I'm sorry for confusing you again."</p><p>She should be. What the actual fuck? For a moment, she turns the blame inward—she should've trusted her instincts. Apparently, the line was Helena's to draw, invisible and telepathic and shifting whenever Helly got too close. She can't make sense of any of it. Maybe Helena's deliberately keeping her off-balance, never letting her get solid ground. Or maybe she's just a body to be used, a proxy to safely experience pleasure and nothing more. Or maybe Helena's so damaged she can't let anyone truly touch her.</p><p>She can't decide which truth would hurt more.</p><p>Helena pulls back again and places a soft kiss to her sister's cheek before lying down again, gently stroking Helly's hair, as if nothing had happened at all.</p><p> </p><p align="center">─•~❉᯽❉~•─</p><p> </p><p>They're in Helena's bed again. Helena's idea, of course. It only makes sense to fall asleep together—why pretend otherwise? Hardly the most bizarre thing they've done in the last few hours.</p><p>Helena's back is flush against Helly's chest, Helly's arm draped protectively around her. Helena had fallen asleep the moment her head hit the pillow. She can feel her sister's breathing, slow and even, the tiny sound she makes on each exhale. She's sick with how much she loves her. She's never experienced anything remotely like this—had convinced herself she never could. Always skating the surface of intimacy, never breaking through. Now she's in complete free fall with no sense of where it ends. The thought that this fall might have a bottom makes her stomach clench.</p><p>But maybe whatever this is could work. It's only been a couple of days. Maybe things would steady out over time. Maybe they could hide what they're doing from the rest of the world. Just be two devoted sisters in the public eye. Unusually close, but not unheard of for twins. Nobody needs to know about the shared bed, about Helly being knuckle deep in Helena whenever possible. It's their business. Their secret to keep.</p><p>The alternative—ending whatever this is—feels so unimaginably horrible, impossible, that any potential consequences had to be worth it. She presses her forehead against the back of Helena's neck and inhales. The salt on her skin, the faint trace of shampoo, it all makes her dizzy.</p><p>She drifts off like that, knowing with certainty that whatever this is, she'll never find it with anyone else.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>A soft rustle. Sunlight bleeding warm through the blinds. Weight in her arms... familiar weight. Rolling over. Something shifting. Consciousness floating back like a tide.</p><p>"God, your arm is so heavy." The voice seeps into Helly's returning awareness. "It's like sleeping under a weighted blanket."</p><p>Helly reluctantly opens her eyes to be met with a sculpture of divine beauty staring back at her. Helena's bangs splay messily across her forehead, little wisps of hair fraying at the sides. Her cavernous hazel eyes catch slats of sunlight, illuminating tiny flecks of gold. Her cheeks carry a soft flush, just enough to define the arches and curves of her bone structure, making her look as if Praxiteles himself had carved her in the throes of longing.</p><p>Then Helena's breath hits her nose and she winces.</p><p>"You should probably brush your teeth," Helly says. "You have crazy morning breath."</p><p>Helena's turn to wince. She makes a face. "I think you're smelling your own. Christ. Did you even brush your teeth last night?"</p><p>"Of course I did."</p><p>She didn't. In her defense, the pilgrimage from the couch to the bedroom had been a blur of laughter and clumsy entanglement. An exercise in staying as close to Helena as possible, as if even an inch between them might shatter whatever spell had brought them back together. She feels utterly fused to the woman in her arms now. Two halves of something that was never meant to be split. </p><p>The last fifteen years of absence weren't just loneliness—they were withdrawal. A Helena-shaped amputation that left her stumbling through life with phantom limb syndrome, reaching with something that wasn't there. Aching in places that no longer existed. Of course she'd been miserable. Of course nothing had ever felt right. She'd been trying to live as half a person, wondering why the world felt so cold and sharp-edged when the answer was here all along, warm and breathing against her.</p><p>"I'm so fucking glad our dad died," Helly says, offhand, like she's commenting on the weather.</p><p>"Me too," Helena responds simply. "Speaking of. I need to get up."</p><p>She rips herself from Helly's arms and rolls out of bed. Immediately, Helly feels the ache of absence clawing itself up her skin, desperately seeking the touch it had just settled into.</p><p>"Why?" Helly asks, nearly whining.</p><p>"Some of us have jobs."</p><p>"Okay. Rude. I <em> had </em>one. Not too long ago either."</p><p>"Right," Helena smirks. "Well, some of us still <em> do</em>."</p><p>"It wasn't even my fault," Helly groans. "The reason I got fired was total bullshit."</p><p>"Uh huh. I'm sure," Helena says, stripping out of her pajamas.</p><p>Helly can't help but stare stupidly at Helena's nude form. A lifetime of control written in sharp hip bones and careful angles. Every inch of softness, rejected. Every human imperfection, carefully erased. Beautiful and heartbreaking. Self-denial manifested.</p><p>"Don't get naked here unless you want me to fuck you again," Helly smiles, sitting up, running her hand through her own hair.</p><p>"Charming," Helena rolls her eyes. "Try brushing your teeth first."</p><p>Helly grumbles and throws off the covers, trailing Helena into the bathroom to join her at the sink. They brush their teeth side by side, elbows bumping—first by accident, then on purpose, each seeking the small collision. It feels just like being kids again, sharing their morning routine. Except now Helena stands bare beside her, and Helly can't stop stealing glances in the mirror.</p><p>Helly sets her toothbrush down and strips to match her. She studies the contrasts in their bodies—nothing she hadn't already noticed, but the differences feel stark when they're standing side by side. Her body's filled out where Helena's retracts, crudely muscled where her sister has cultivated pure functionality.  She looks like she could cradle Helena or crush her with equal ease. She catches Helena staring and wonders if the disparity turns her on, too.</p><p>Helly spits out her toothpaste. "Okay, I brushed my teeth."</p><p>Helena spits out her toothpaste. "Do you want me to congratulate you?"</p><p>Helly throws her head back and laughs. "When are you gonna stop acting like you don't want me to fuck you?"</p><p>"Maybe when I don't have a board meeting in an hour," Helena says flatly, grabbing one of several identical swimsuits from the cabinet.</p><p>"Didn't know your board meeting was in the ocean," Helly lifts a brow. "Is that why you guys are always talking about sharks?"</p><p>"You're just hilarious this morning."</p><p>"Jesus," Helly chokes out an awkward laugh, face dropping. "What happened? You were in such a good mood last night."</p><p>"Just—can you let me wake up a bit?"</p><p>"Okay," Helly throws her hands up. "Sorry."</p><p>Helena sighs. "It's fine. I need to go do my laps. Do you need more clothes?"</p><p>"I have some in my car," Helly says. "I was gonna grab some yesterday but I wasn't sure how long I'm staying."</p><p>Helena finishes pulling her swimsuit up, then looks at Helly like she's crazy. "Aren't you moving in?"</p><p>"What?" They hadn't talked about it. They hadn't so much as talked about Helly staying another night.</p><p>"You're homeless," Helena says, almost cutting in her tone, how obvious it should be. "I," she gestures around, "have a home. A big one."</p><p>Helly supposes it is pretty obvious. It's just a paradigm shift that leaves her completely unmoored. Three days ago, she couldn't even fathom the events that would've had to take place to lead her here.</p><p>"Yeah. I guess. Well, thanks," Helly says, a crooked smile tugging at the corner of her mouth.</p><p>"You really don't have to thank me."</p><p>"Well it would be weird if I didn't."</p><p>Without another word, Helena starts heading down the hallway. Helly instantly feels lost. She's not sure what she's supposed to be doing this morning. Or today. Or this week. Or the rest of her life. Everything has been suddenly replaced with a flash of red hair vanishing into the labyrinth.</p><p>She supposes she can shadow Helena's routine for the day. At least until she gets her bearings. She grabs one of Helena's swimsuits and slides it on, the fabric clinging like a second skin. She ties her hair back and catches her reflection, startled—thrilled—by how much she resembles her sister in this getup. Her hand drifts south and she palms her center over the nylon before she stops herself and heads to the pool. Why settle for this when she can have the real thing?</p><p>She notices Helena's phone light up on the nightstand. New message, but the screen is locked. She hovers over it just long enough for Face ID to unlock, almost laughing that even Apple thinks she could pass for Helena with her hair up. The message appears from an unsaved number, clearly continuing some conversation. It simply reads: "Results came back this morning. Nothing. All good."</p><p>Cryptic Lumon bullshit, probably. Whatever. </p><p>Helena's already started her laps by the time Helly gets down there. Helly sits at the pool's edge, kicking her feet in the water, content to wait until Helena notices and acknowledges her presence—what else is there to do anyway? She watches her sister swim with uncanny consistency, back and forth in perfect rhythm. There's no timer, but she's sure each lap would fall within milliseconds of the others. It nearly lulls her into a trance.</p><p>"Nice lap!" Helly yells out after another identical one.</p><p>Helena doesn't so much as flinch. Just keeps going with that same perfect freestyle, so practiced Helly's sure her body would keep doing it even if you removed her brain entirely.</p><p>Finally, after swimming what had to be the length of the Atlantic Ocean, Helena stops at the edge and flips her goggles up.</p><p>"When did you get here?" she yells across the pool.</p><p>"You seriously didn't hear me?" Helly jumps in, wading towards her sister.</p><p>Helena shakes her head and yanks her swim cap off. Helly wades closer, drawing her arms back like she's loading a cannon.</p><p>"Helly, wait, I don't want to—"</p><p>Helly launches forward, sending a massive wave crashing over Helena's head.</p><p>"...wash my hair," Helena finishes. "You fucking bitch."</p><p>"What're you gonna do about it?" Helly taunts.</p><p>Helena draws her arms back as far as they'll go and claps them together right in Helly's face. Water shoots straight up her nose and she sputters. </p><p>"Oh, you cunt," Helly laughs.</p><p>They continue, the splash fight turning less playful and more vicious with each passing second. There's an air of something sinister. Unspoken tensions that haven't been resolved yet, bubbling up under the guise of play. It starts turning physical—a shoulder push, a kick to the thigh, a palm strike to the collarbone. Each blow releases more adrenaline, escalating the violence until Helly hits her breaking point when Helena drives a particularly brutal strike into her ribs.</p><p>"Ow—<em> fuck</em>, what the fuck is wrong with you?" Helly yells, sick of her sister playing dirty just because she's smaller. It's been like this since they were kids. Helly always having to hold back, Helena getting to do whatever she wants. Pushing the limits, poking the bear, just to see what she can get away with. It all comes rushing back and threatens to drown her. She decides to drown Helena instead.</p><p>She pushes Helena's head under the water—just enough to scare her. Just enough to remind her who's stronger, who's really in control. She feels her sister struggle underneath her, kicking at her legs, clawing at her arms nearly hard enough to break the skin. She holds her down just a second longer than necessary before finally letting her come up for air.</p><p>Helena surfaces and coughs. Mostly air. Just a bit of water. Nothing serious. She probably inhaled a bit on purpose just to make Helly feel bad. She isn't falling for it. </p><p>"Maybe don't try to break my ribs next time," Helly says, trying to keep her voice flat. She's just settling a score. That's all. Nothing to do with exorcising something ugly and half-formed that's been festering under her skin.</p><p>"What the fuck—" Helena chokes out between coughs, "—is actually—wrong with you." She grabs the edge of the pool, draws in a ragged breath, and hacks to scrape the last of it from her lungs.</p><p>"You're so dramatic," Helly says, rolling her eyes, pretending she doesn't taste the guilt rising in the back of her throat.</p><p>Helena hangs on the edge, cheek pressed to her forearm, catching her breath. Staring up at Helly with those big, stupid eyes. She looks pathetic, delicate in a way that makes Helly feel cruel. Breakable. Something that shouldn't be handled without care. Helly tries to swallow it down—what she's just done. It was justified. Or maybe it wasn't. It happened all the same.</p><p>Helena keeps breathing, staring. The air between them feels warped, like heat rising off asphalt. Bending everything just enough to blur Helly's vision.</p><p>Suddenly, Helena closes the distance between them, lips crashing onto her sister's. She claws at Helly's swimsuit, then her arms, then her hair, then the back of her neck, like she's trying to crawl inside her skin. Helly can hardly breathe with her nose crushed against Helena's face. It's disorienting, it's frantic, it's the best kiss she's ever had. She does her best to keep up, parting her lips just enough for Helena's tongue to enter like a violent intruder, wrestling with Helly's for ownership of her mouth. </p><p>Helena pulls back just enough to make one simple request against Helly's lips: "Fuck me."</p><p>The guilt lingering in Helly's throat transforms into raw hunger. She needs to devour Helena, needs to obliterate the space between want and having, needs to finish what last night barely started. With strength that surprises them both, she hoists Helena onto the pool's edge and crashes between her thighs. Her mouth finds Helena's center through the wet nylon, too desperate to waste time moving fabric aside.</p><p>Helena gasps at the contact, fisting Helly's drenched hair as it spills from its tie. Helly's mouth ruts against the fabric like she could taste Helena through pure force of will, too frantic to stop for logistics. Finally, desperation wins—she tears herself away and hooks her fingers into the edge of Helena's swimsuit, wrenching it aside with brutal efficiency. Her cunt stares back, swollen with need, entrance clenching around nothing. Desperate to be filled by her sister. The sight makes Helly's mouth water.</p><p>She's aching to dive in, but she wants this answer worse: "Has anyone ever done this for you before?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>She could weep from the privilege of it—she gets to be the first tongue to savor what her sister never shared with another soul. The possessiveness burns through her like fever. Fighting every impulse to devour Helena whole, she forces herself to pause. To memorize the sight, the scent, the way Helena watches her like she's salvation incarnate. It's sacred, it's profane, it's unraveling her sanity.</p><p>She rests her forehead on Helena's thigh for just a moment before trailing her face upward, her nose dragging across chlorinated skin, her lips catching on raised goosebumps. She reaches Helena's outer lips and opens her mouth, pressing soft, wet kisses along her sister's sex, working inward with agonizing slowness. Each kiss rewrites her own history—erasing porn, erasing her ex, erasing everything she thought was pleasure. This is the new baseline. Living through what she already knows will ruin her for everything else.</p><p>She takes a long drag of her tongue from Helena's entrance up to the base of her clit, stopping just short. Helena's body arches above her, thighs trembling against Helly's ears as she fights to suppress her moans. Helly's own cunt throbs in sympathy. She lets the taste settle across her tongue, exhaling slowly to capture every note. It's nothing like she imagined and exactly what she craved. The only thing she ever wants to taste again.</p><p>"You better fucking come this time," Helly breathes against her cunt, lip grazing her clit with each syllable. She feels Helena shudder above her. </p><p>She starts with the flat of her tongue, painting broad strokes around Helena's clit. Each pass draws closer, circling the swollen nerve until Helena's breathing turns ragged above her. When she finally makes contact—just the tip of her tongue—Helena's entire body jerks. Helly grins against her cunt and repeats the motion, lingering a heartbeat longer this time, savoring the sharp pull of Helena's fingers in her hair. She varies between soft flicks and measured circles, devouring every accidental sound and uncontrolled movement, taking note of exactly what makes Helena's legs lock around her head.</p><p>She feels Helena cresting already, getting close to the peak. It's only been seconds but Helly can tell—she's already fighting a losing battle against herself, helpless under her sister's practiced tongue. </p><p>Then, suddenly, Helena yanks Helly's head back. She nudges Helly backwards in the water with her foot, then slides into the pool.</p><p>"What the fuck?" Helly asks, more confused than anything.</p><p>"I didn't really like that," Helena lies, her ragged breathing giving her away completely. "I like your fingers better, can you do that?"</p><p>Helly blinks. "Didn't like it? You were about to come."</p><p>"No I wasn't," Helena shakes her head, giving Helly that exasperated <em> are you crazy </em> look—the same one she's been perfecting for decades.</p><p>Helly drags the back of her hand across her chin, Helena's wetness still coating her lips. She could argue the point—the evidence is literally dripping down her face—but Helena's standing there looking wound tight and needy, and Helly would rather fuck her than prove her wrong.</p><p>"Yeah, okay, fine," Helly nods, pressing her body against Helena's until she's pinned against the pool's edge. Helena winces as the rough concrete digs into her back.</p><p>"Sorry," Helly mutters. "I'll be gentler."</p><p>She lifts Helena's thigh and gets straight to business. Two fingers slip inside easily while her thumb finds its target, falling into the practiced rhythm that's already becoming second nature. It's weird how quickly they've developed their own choreography.</p><p>Helena melts against her, chin dropping to Helly's shoulder as soft moans spill from her lips. There's something achingly vulnerable about holding Helena like this—her sister's body soft and yielding, completely surrendered to Helly's touch. She can feel Helena tightening around her fingers already, so much quicker to respond now, like she's finally letting herself want this. The realization sends heat shooting straight to Helly's own cunt, an ache so sharp it's almost painful.</p><p>"Helena," Helly breathes against her sister's ear. "Please touch me. Please."</p><p>Helena presses her face into the curve of Helly's neck. "I really don't know what I'm doing."</p><p>"Just <em> try.</em>"</p><p>"I don't even know where to start."</p><p>Helly's patience snaps. "Fine," she says, yanking Helena's thigh up and wedging it between her own legs. "Then we'll just do this."</p><p>Helly grinds herself against Helena's thigh and nearly moans with relief. Friction. Beautiful, wonderful friction. She ruts against the firm muscle frantically, chasing any sensation that might ease the ache. She knows it won't be enough to finish, but it's better than the torture of going untouched. </p><p>It seems to turn Helena on, too. She clenches around Helly's fingers with renewed intensity. Her clit is so swollen and sensitive it pulses under every touch. The moans pouring from her throat turn raw and unrestrained, vibrating against Helly's shoulder like she's lost all control.</p><p>Helena's right there, balanced on the knife's edge of release. Helly won't let her get away this time. She doubles down, working her clit relentlessly. Her wrist starts to cramp, but she doesn't care. It's worth it.</p><p>She can feel, for whatever stupid fucking reason, Helena resisting her own release again, but it's too late. She's past the point of no return, about to topple over.</p><p>And then she does.</p><p>Helena's orgasm hits like a dam bursting. A strangled cry tears from her throat and she bites down hard on Helly's shoulder, teeth sinking deep enough to leave a bruise. Helena's hips buck wildly, riding Helly's fingers as waves of release crash through her. Her whole body trembles with an intensity that seems to surprise even her. She's completely undone, all pretense of control shattered. </p><p>Helena's release flows around Helly's fingers, the warmth shocking against the chill of the pool. There's so much of it, so much heat, that she realizes this might just be Helena's normal—squirting every time, her body incapable of anything restrained. The idea makes her own arousal spike painfully.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, Helly would be perfectly happy holding Helena through her earth-shattering orgasm, but she's so desperately horny she can barely think straight. Still, she waits it out, refusing to interrupt when Helena's probably experienced more pleasure in the last thirty seconds than in the previous decade combined.</p><p>Finally, after the last wave passes, Helly tears her sister off of her.</p><p>"Helena, you have to touch me. You <em> have </em>to."</p><p>"Helly—"</p><p>"I'm gonna lose my mind. I'm not touching myself again. I need it to be you. I don't care how bad you are. Just fucking touch me."</p><p>Helena looks like she's trying to blink herself back into consciousness. Helly gets it—her sister just had what might qualify as a life-altering experience. But empathy can't override the hollow ache, the need so crazed it feels like it might devour her.</p><p>"Helena," she says, patience thinning.</p><p>"Sorry. Okay," Helena responds, nodding, still dazed.</p><p>Thank fucking god. She stares at Helena, waiting for her to make a move. Anything. Literally <em> anything </em>except standing there motionless like she's doing right now. And still doing. And still doing.</p><p>"<em>Helena</em>," she says more firmly.</p><p>"What do I do?"</p><p>"Oh my <em> god</em>," Helly groans, ripping her own swimsuit to the side. She grabs Helena's wrist and pulls it to her own cunt. "Pressure. On my clit. Exactly what I just did to you. Just <em> try</em>."</p><p>"Okay, I'll try," Helena says, biting her lip like she's approaching a test she didn't study for. She presses her index finger tentatively to Helly's clit, and Helly nearly melts with relief. She braces her hands on either side of Helena against the pool's edge, finally getting some of the contact she's been craving.</p><p>"That's…fine. Keep going, I can probably come from this," Helly says. It's not fine, really. It's quite bad. Helena wasn't kidding. She really has no idea how to do this at all. But it's still better than nothing, feeling the hand she's been fantasizing about for days finally touching where she needs it most.</p><p>"Like that?" Helena asks.</p><p>"More pressure," Helly says. "Way more."</p><p>She leans in to kiss Helena, her sister's taste still lingering on her tongue. It feels good, Helena's clumsy ministrations on her clit while Helly deepens the kiss, sharing the flavor of Helena's arousal between them. She's so worked up that even this might be enough to get her there.</p><p>And then Helena's movements get even sloppier.</p><p>Helly pulls back. "What are you doing?"</p><p>Helena shakes her head. "Sorry. You were distracting me."</p><p>Helly can't help but laugh. She's never been with someone this inexperienced—someone who can't even pretend confidence. Part of her wonders if Helena's sabotaging this on purpose, but one look at her face reveals raw vulnerability that Helena's never let show before. The insecurity is painfully, unmistakably real.</p><p>"It's okay," Helly says gently.</p><p>"I'm sorry," Helena responds quietly, embarrassment etched across her features.</p><p>Helly pulls her into a hug and presses a soft kiss to her cheek. "You're so fucking funny, you know that?"</p><p>"I'm not trying to be."</p><p>"I know." Helly places a longer, more heated kiss along Helena's jaw. "Let me guide you."</p><p>She takes Helena's smaller hand and covers it with her own, guiding it between her legs. She presses Helena's finger down with the right pressure, moving it in slow circles with just enough friction. Bracing herself against the pool's edge with her free hand, she leans her forehead against Helena's, breathing hot against her lips.</p><p>Even with her own hand driving, it feels fucking good. Just knowing Helena's fingers are the ones beneath hers, actually touching her, delicate and foreign, makes everything more intense. Looking into Helena's eyes, she can see the desire there, the desperate need to please her big sister.</p><p>"<em>Fuck</em>," Helly moans. "Just like this."</p><p>"Okay," Helena breathes against her lips. "I think I got it."</p><p>Helly pulls her hand away and lets Helena take the wheel. The rhythm falters a bit, but it's much better than before. She'll definitely be able to finish—sooner rather than later, too.</p><p>"Are you gonna keep going if I kiss you?" Helly teases.</p><p>Helena laughs, barely. "You're such an asshole."</p><p>She kisses Helena and feels the rhythm stumble exactly as expected. But it's not as bad as last time, and kissing Helena while she's this close to the edge is a worthy trade-off. She just wants to fucking come. Worse than anything in the world.</p><p>She feels herself getting close, finally, mercifully, and begs against Helena's lips. "Faster."</p><p>Helena picks up the pace, maddeningly slipping on and off Helly's clit, but it's enough. Her body locks up, tight and trembling, and then—release. It tears through her like a snapped wire, sudden and electric, and she gasps against Helena's lips as her hips jerk forward. Her cunt clenches around nothing, pulsing hard, while Helena keeps touching her with that same careful, clumsy rhythm. A broken moan escapes as Helly's mouth falls open against her sister's cheek, every nerve ending on fire. It doesn't matter that Helena's technique is really, truly terrible—it's <em> her </em>hand. That makes it infinitely better than anything she could do to herself.</p><p>Helly takes a shaky breath to steady herself, then slowly peels herself away. Helena's staring at her intensely with this satisfied, analytical look, like she just cracked some complex equation that's been nagging at her for weeks. It's strange how Helena never seems to have a normal reaction to anything, but whatever—Helly's pretty sure there's no etiquette guide for post-orgasm behavior with your sister, so she'll let it slide.</p><p>"Thanks," Helly says simply. "I know that was hard for you."</p><p>Helena smiles just a bit, then presses a quick peck to Helly's lips. She turns around and hoists herself out of the pool.</p><p>"Where are you going?" Helly asks, dazed.</p><p>"I'm so fucking late for my meeting."</p>
