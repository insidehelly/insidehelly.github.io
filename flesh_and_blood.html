    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>Helena pushes open the door to her shared bedroom, eyes glued to her phone screen where some moron on Tumblr is butchering her favorite novel, completely missing the point about the unreliable narrator—<em>God, do people even read anymore</em>—when a voice cuts through her irritation like a blade.</p><p>"Mind closing the door?"</p><p>Her eyes dart to Helly's side of the room to find her sister sprawled across her bed, legs spread wide like she owns the world, phone glowing in one hand while the other moves beneath her jeans in a steady, hypnotic rhythm.</p><p>"What are you doing?" Helena asks.</p><p>Helly stills her movement and looks up. "Can you close the fucking door before someone walks by?"</p><p>Helena shoves her phone in her pocket and closes the door. "<em>What </em> are you doing?"</p><p>"What does it look like I'm doing?" Helly mutters, eyes back on her phone, fingers still moving like Helena doesn’t exist.</p><p>Helena stares, frozen, because surely Helly can't be serious. But she is, she's actually doing this, right here in front of her.</p><p>"Oh my god, I'm just rubbing one out," Helly responds, as if that were really the question being asked. As if <em> Helena's </em> the one being weird about it.</p><p>"That's disgusting," Helena says, unsure if she's trying to convince Helly or herself. "You really shouldn't be doing that."</p><p>Helly's hand goes still, and suddenly Helena is pinned under that look—the one reserved for Helena's most spectacular displays of innocence, that familiar glare of fascination and pity. "Are you seriously trying to tell me you've never masturbated?"</p><p>The word sounds foreign and slightly dangerous on Helly's tongue. Helena shakes her head. Helly rolls her eyes, shrugs in a way that says <em> not my problem</em>, and gets back to business.</p><p>Helena finds herself moving forward, drawn by a curiosity stronger than her feigned revulsion, until she can see what has Helly so captivated—two women pressed together, moving with a crude urgency that makes Helena's throat constrict around something. Something that tastes like forbidden fruit. Their bodies are speaking a language Helena doesn't understand, but feels in her moldering bones.</p><p>"Oh wow," she breathes.</p><p>It strikes her as strange that Helly is getting off on watching two girls together, but something tells her not to mention it. The whole situation feels charged and delicate.</p><p>"I'm not gay, by the way," Helly says, as if reading her thoughts. "I just don't like how every guy in porn is ugly."</p><p>Helena nods, though she's not entirely sure she understands the distinction.</p><p>"You want to try it?"</p><p>Helena shakes her head before she can really think about it. The whole thing feels too dirty, too shameful, something they definitely shouldn't be doing. But watching Helly, she feels something closer to envy than judgment. Her sister's complete lack of self-consciousness is almost admirable.</p><p>"You sure? I could show you how to do it. It's not that hard," Helly pushes.</p><p>"I'm fine," Helena insists, biting back a bitter laugh. Helly sees a skill to learn; Helena sees quicksand that would drag her under with one wrong step. Her sister can't even conceptualize the shame that lives in Helena's chest like a second heart, pumping poison instead of blood. Still, she can't drag her eyes away.</p><p>"It's kinda weird that you're staring at me like that," Helly says, annoyance threading through her voice.</p><p>Helena's cheeks ignite with the burn of her own hypocrisy. "Sorry." </p><p>She tears her eyes away, bouncing onto her bed and pulling out her phone. The scrolling is theater, her peripheral vision doing all the real work—watching, waiting, stealing moments when Helly's focus drifts.</p><p>Helly's breathing fractures into short bursts. Her movements become more urgent, soft little moans escaping her lips. Helena abandons all pretense, staring openly, transfixed by the way pleasure rewrites her sister's face.</p><p>It looks so intense, so all-consuming. Something awakens in Helena's body—a pulse between her legs that screams for her attention. She wants to touch herself, yes, but that want gets swallowed by something larger: the need to crawl into her sister's bed, to coil around her, to dissolve into whatever this is. She can't parse which desire would corrupt her worse, which would leave her more filthy, or if the mere fact that both hungers are clawing at her insides means she's already lost.</p><p>Finally, Helly's back lifts from the bed and a gasp shatters the silence between them. Her body locks, then melts, currents of something unknowable flooding through her. It looks like her soul is trying to tear its way out of her skin. Helena's never seen beauty this violent—she feels it echo through her own flesh in the way her muscles tense, the way her skin flushes, as if pleasure could be contagious.</p><p>When it's over, Helly calmly removes her hand from her pants. Her fingers are coated with something slick and glistening. Without hesitation, she shakes them off and wipes them on her sheets, then starts scrolling like nothing happened.</p><p>Helena feels like she can barely breathe. Heat is radiating through her entire body, and there's an ache between her legs that borders on painful. She needs to be closer to Helly, needs some kind of contact.</p><p>She waits a few agonizing moments, just enough to maintain the illusion of coincidence, then snuggles up next to her sister—not unusual for them, they've shared this kind of closeness forever. But this time there's intention behind the movement, angling her face close to the hand that was just buried in denim.</p><p>She draws in a careful, intentional breath, and the scent hits her like a drug. It's musky and warm and completely disorienting. Her brain shorts out, desire wiping her mind clean, leaving only the magnetic pull toward her sister's hand. She has to fight the rotten, animal urge to close the distance, to press her nose flush against those fingers, to taste what's left there.</p><p>"Look at this," Helly laughs, thrusting her phone toward Helena, completely oblivious to the way her sister is vibrating with need beside her.</p><p>Helena tries to focus on the screen, tries to laugh at the right moments, but everything feels distant compared to the scent still clinging to her nose, the image of Helly's face contorting with ecstasy, the way her own flesh screams for something beyond language. </p><p>She nods and smiles while her sister scrolls, wearing the mask of who she used to be. Playing the part of innocent Helena, like she could perform her way back to who she was. But the foundation has shifted beneath her. All those rules that once felt sacred, all that shame that stopped her from becoming unholy, all feel suddenly thin. </p><p>Ready to tear at the slightest touch.</p>
